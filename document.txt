Restoring Internet Freedom
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking – WC Docket No. 17-108
Background: For almost twenty years, the Internet flourished under a light-touch regulatory approach.
During this time, the Internet underwent rapid, and unprecedented, growth. Internet service providers
(ISPs) invested approximately $1.5 trillion in the Internet ecosystem, and American consumers
enthusiastically responded. Businesses developed in ways that government officials could not have
fathomed even a decade ago. The Internet became an ever-increasing part of the American economy,
offering new and innovative changes in how we work, learn, receive medical care, and entertain
ourselves. The Commission’s 2015 decision to subject ISPs to Title II utility-style regulations risks that
innovation, serving ultimately to threaten the open Internet it purported to preserve.
The Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has proposed a Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (NPRM) to end the utility-style regulatory approach that gives government control of the
Internet and to restore the market-based policies necessary to preserve the future of Internet Freedom, and
to reverse the decline in infrastructure investment, innovation, and options for consumers put into motion
by the FCC in 2015. To determine how to best honor our commitment to restoring Internet Freedom, the
NPRM also evaluates the existing rules governing Internet service providers’ practices.

What the NPRM Would Do:









Propose to reinstate the information service classification of broadband Internet access service
and return to the light-touch regulatory framework first established on a bipartisan basis during
the Clinton Administration.
Propose to reinstate the determination that mobile broadband Internet access service is not a
commercial mobile service and in conjunction revisit the elements of the Title II Order that
modified or reinterpreted key terms in section 332 of the Communications Act and our
implementing rules.
Propose to return authority to the Federal Trade Commission to police the privacy practices of
Internet service providers.
Propose to eliminate the vague Internet conduct standard.
Seek comment on whether to keep, modify, or eliminate the bright-line rules set forth in the Title
II Order.
Propose to re-evaluate the Commission’s enforcement regime to analyze whether ex ante
regulatory intervention in the market is necessary.
Propose to conduct a cost-benefit analysis as part of this proceeding.

This document is being released as part of a “permit-but-disclose” proceeding. Any presentations or views on the
subject expressed to the Commission or its staff, including by email, must be filed in WC Docket No. 17-108, which

INTRODUCTION

1.
Americans cherish a free and open Internet. And for almost twenty years, the Internet
flourished under a light touch regulatory approach. It was a framework that our nation’s elected leaders
put in place on a bipartisan basis. President Clinton and a Republican Congress passed the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, which established the policy of the United States “to preserve the
vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet . . . unfettered by Federal or State
regulation.”1
2.
During this time, the Internet underwent rapid, and unprecedented, growth.2 Internet
service providers (ISPs) invested over $1.5 trillion in the Internet ecosystem3 and American consumers
enthusiastically responded. Businesses developed in ways that the policy makers could not have
fathomed even a decade ago. Google, Facebook, Netflix, and countless other online businesses launched
in this country and became worldwide success stories. The Internet became an ever-increasing part of the
American economy, offering new and innovative changes in how we work, learn, receive medical care,
and entertain ourselves.4
3.
But two years ago, the FCC changed course. It decided to apply utility-style regulation to
the Internet. This decision represented a massive and unprecedented shift in favor of government control
of the Internet.
4.
The Commission’s Title II Order has put at risk online investment and innovation,
threatening the very open Internet it purported to preserve. Investment in broadband networks declined.
Internet service providers have pulled back on plans to deploy new and upgraded infrastructure and
services to consumers. This is particularly true of the smallest Internet service providers that serve
consumers in rural, low-income, and other underserved communities. Many good-paying jobs were lost

as the result of these pull backs. And the order has weakened Americans’ online privacy by stripping the
Federal Trade Commission—the nation’s premier consumer protection agency—of its jurisdiction over
ISPs’ privacy and data security practices.
5.
Today, we take a much-needed first step toward returning to the successful bipartisan
framework that created the free and open Internet and, for almost twenty years, saw it flourish. By
proposing to end the utility-style regulatory approach that gives government control of the Internet, we
aim to restore the market-based policies necessary to preserve the future of Internet Freedom, and to
reverse the decline in infrastructure investment, innovation, and options for consumers put into motion by
the FCC in 2015. Our actions today continue our critical work to promote broadband deployment to rural
consumers and infrastructure investment throughout our nation, to brighten the future of innovation both
within networks and at their edge, and to close the digital divide.

BACKGROUND

6.
Long before the commercialization of the Internet, federal law drew a line between the
heavily regulated common carrier services and more lightly regulated services that went beyond mere
transmission. Starting in 1966, the Commission initiated the Computer Inquiries,5 which created a
dichotomy between basic and enhanced services.6 Basic services offered “pure transmission capability
over a communications path that is virtually transparent in terms of its interaction with customer supplied
information”7 and were “regulated under Title II of the [Communications] Act.”8 Enhanced services were
“any offering over the telecommunications network which is more than a basic transmission service. In
an enhanced service, for example, computer processing applications are used to act on the content, code,
protocol, and other aspects of the subscriber’s information.”9 Unlike basic services, the Commission
found that “enhanced services should not be regulated under the Act.”10
7.
Just two years later, the federal courts would draw a similar line in resolving the
government’s antitrust case against AT&T. The Modification of Final Judgment (MFJ) of 1982
distinguished between “telecommunications services,” which Bell Operating Companies could offer when
“actually regulated by tariff,”11 and “information services,” including “data processing and other
computer-related services”12 and “electronic publishing services,”13 which Bell Operating Companies
were prohibited from offering entirely.14
8.
In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, intended to “promote competition and reduce
regulation,”15 President Clinton and Congress drew a line between lightly regulated “information

services” and more heavily regulated “telecommunications services.”16 They also found that the “Internet
and other interactive computer services have flourished, to the benefit of all Americans, with a minimum
of government regulation”17 and declared it the policy of the United States to “promote the continued
development of the Internet and other interactive computer services and other interactive media” and “to
preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet and other interactive
computer services, unfettered by Federal or State regulation.”18 The 1996 Act went on to define
“interactive computer service” to include “any information service, system, or access software provider
that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server, including specifically a
service or system that provides access to the Internet . . . .”19
9.
Congress weighed in again two years later. Five Senators—John Ashcroft, Wendell
Ford, John F. Kerry, Spencer Abraham, and Ron Wyden—wrote the Commission that “[n]othing in the
1996 Act or its legislative history suggests that Congress intended to alter the current classification of
Internet and other information services or to expand traditional telephone regulation to new and advanced
services.”20 These five members further warned that if the Commission “subject[ed] some or all
information service providers to telephone regulation, it seriously would chill the growth and
development of advanced services to the detriment of our economic and educational well-being.”21
10.
For the next 16 years, the Commission repeatedly followed their advice, opting for a
light-touch approach to the Internet that favored discrete and targeted actions over traditional pre-emptive,
sweeping regulation of Internet service providers. In the 1998 Stevens Report, the Commission
comprehensively reviewed the Act’s definitions as they applied to the emerging technology of the Internet
and concluded that Internet access service was properly classified as an information service.22 The
Stevens Report exhaustively reviewed the text and legislative history of the Telecommunications Act,
along with the agency’s own administrative precedent and the courts’ administration of antitrust law.23
Looking to the Act’s text, the Commission concluded that “Internet access providers do not offer a pure
transmission path; they combine computer processing, information provision, and other computermediated offerings with data transport,”24 and it “recognize[d] the unique qualities of the Internet, and
[did] not presume that legacy regulatory frameworks are appropriately applied to it.”25 Further, even
“address[ing] the classification of Internet access service de novo” the Stevens Report reached the same
quality services for American telecommunications consumers and encourage the rapid deployment of new
telecommunications technologies”).

conclusion: Internet access service is an information service according to the statute.26 The Stevens
Report also found that subjecting Internet service providers and other information service providers to
“the broad range of Title II constraints,” would “seriously curtail the regulatory freedom that the
Commission concluded in Computer II was important to the healthy and competitive development of the
enhanced-services industry.”27
11.
In the 2002 Cable Modem Order, the Commission classified broadband Internet access
service over cable systems as an “interstate information service.”28 The Commission did so based on the
“functions that cable modem service makes available to its end users,”29 on the fact that the
“telecommunications component is not, however, separable from the data-processing capabilities of the
service,”30 and is an information service “regardless of whether subscribers use all of the functions
provided as part of the service, such as e-mail or web-hosting, and regardless of whether every cable
modem service provider offers each function that could be included in the service.”31 The Commission
was also guided by its belief that “broadband services should exist in a minimal regulatory environment
that promotes investment and innovation in a competitive market,”32 and the knowledge that regulatory
uncertainty “may discourage investment and innovation.”33
12.
In June 2005, the Supreme Court decisively upheld the Commission’s 2002 classification
of broadband Internet access service over cable systems as a lightly-regulated Title I information
service.34
13.
In 2004, then FCC-Chairman Michael Powell announced four principles for Internet
freedom to further ensure that the Internet would remain a place for free and open innovation with
minimal regulation.35 These four “Internet freedoms” include the freedom to access lawful content, the
freedom to use applications, the freedom to attach personal devices to the network, and the freedom to
obtain service plan information.36
14.
In the 2005 Wireline Broadband Classification Order, the Commission classified
broadband Internet access service over wireline facilities as an information service.37 In reaching this
conclusion, the Commission relied on the plain text of the Act, finding that “providers of wireline

broadband Internet access service offer subscribers the ability to run a variety of applications that fit
under the characteristics stated in the information service definition,”38 and that users of wireline
broadband Internet access service were provided “more than [a] pure transmission path” whenever they
accessed the Internet.39
15.
In 2005, the Commission also unanimously endorsed the four Internet freedoms in the
Internet Policy Statement.40 The Internet Policy Statement announced the Commission’s intent to
“incorporate [these] principles into its ongoing policymaking activities” in order to “foster creation,
adoption and use of Internet broadband content, applications, services and attachments, and to ensure
consumers benefit from the innovation that comes from competition.”41
16.
In the 2006 BPL-Enabled Broadband Order, the Commission concluded that broadband
Internet access service over power lines was properly classified as an information service.42 This decision
established “a minimal regulatory environment” which promoted “ubiquitous availability of broadband to
all Americans.”43 The Commission noted that broadband-powerline-enabled Internet access service
“combines computer processing, information provision, and computer interactivity with data transport,
[which] enable[es] end users to run a variety of applications,”44 and concluded that classification as an
information service “encourage[es] the deployment of broadband Internet access services.”45
17.
In the 2007 Wireless Broadband Internet Access Order, the Commission classified
wireless broadband Internet access service as an information service, again recognizing the “minimal
regulatory environment” that promoted the “ubiquitous availability of broadband to all Americans.”46
Consistent with its prior interpretations, the Commission concluded that “wireless broadband Internet
access service offers a single, integrated service to end users, Internet access, that inextricably combines
the transmission of data with computer processing, information provision, and computer interactivity, for
the purpose of enabling end users to run a variety of applications.”47 The Commission also found that
“mobile wireless broadband Internet access service is not a ‘commercial mobile radio service’ as that
term is defined in the Act and implemented in the Commission’s rules.”48

federal Internet policy consistent with the Internet Policy Statement, finding Comcast’s actions
“contravene[d] . . . federal policy” by “significantly imped[ing] consumers’ ability to access the content
and use the applications of their choice.”49 In 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit
rejected the Commission’s action, holding that the Commission had not justified its action as a valid
exercise of ancillary authority.50
19.
In response, the Commission adopted the 2010 Open Internet Order, where once again
the Commission specifically rejected more heavy-handed regulation of broadband Internet access
service.51 Instead, the Open Internet Order relied on, among other things, newly-claimed regulatory
authority under section 706 of the Telecommunications Act to establish no-blocking and nounreasonable-discrimination rules as well as a requirement that broadband Internet access service
providers “publicly disclose accurate information regarding the network management practices,
performance, and commercial terms of its broadband Internet access services.”52 In doing so, the
Commission distinguished between fixed and mobile broadband Internet access services, reasoning that
the latter “presents special considerations that suggest differences in how and when open Internet
protections should apply.”53
20.
In 2014, the D.C. Circuit vacated the no-blocking and no-unreasonable-discrimination
rules adopted in the Open Internet Order, finding that the rules impermissibly regulated broadband
Internet access service providers as common carriers,54 in conflict with the Commission’s prior
determination that broadband Internet access service was not a telecommunications service and that
mobile broadband Internet access service was not a commercial mobile service.55 The D.C. Circuit
nonetheless upheld the transparency rule,56 claimed the Commission had authority to regulate broadband
Internet access service providers under section 706 of the Telecommunications Act, and suggested that
no-blocking and no-unreasonable-discrimination rules might be permissible if Internet service providers
could engage in individualized bargaining.57
21.
Later that year, the Commission embarked yet again down the path of rulemaking,
proposing to rely on section 706 of the Telecommunications Act to adopt enforceable rules using the

the Commission was bound in Comcast by a prior Commission determination that section 706 did not constitute a

court’s “roadmap.”58
22.
In November 2014, then-President Obama called on the FCC to “reclassify consumer
broadband service under Title II of the Telecommunications Act.”59 Three months later, the Commission
adopted the Title II Order, reclassifying broadband Internet access services from information services to
telecommunications services.60 In doing so, the Commission found it necessary to forbear from enforcing
the “vast majority of rules adopted under Title II,” including “30 statutory provisions[,] and render over
700 codified rules inapplicable.”61 The Commission adopted no-blocking, no-throttling, and no-paidprioritization rules, as well as a general Internet conduct standard and “enhancements” to the transparency
rule.62 In 2016, a divided panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Title II Order in United
States Telecom Ass’n v. FCC.63 Petitioners have sought a rehearing of the case en banc.64

23.
Between enactment of the Telecommunications Act and the 2015 adoption of the Title II
Order, the free and open Internet flourished: Providers invested over $1.5 trillion to construct networks;
high-speed Internet access proliferated at affordable rates; and consumers were able to enjoy all that the
Internet had to offer. In 2015, the Commission abruptly departed from its prior posture and classified
broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service subject to public-utility regulations
under Title II.
24.
Today, we propose to reinstate the information service classification of broadband
Internet access service and return to the light-touch regulatory framework first established on a bipartisan
basis during the Clinton Administration. We also propose to reinstate the determination that mobile
broadband Internet access service is not a commercial mobile service.
A.

Reinstating the Information Service Classification of Broadband Internet Access
Service

25.
Our proposal to classify broadband Internet access service as an information service is
based on a number of factors. First, we examine the text, structure, and history of the Communications
Act and the Telecommunications Act, combined with the technical details of how the Internet works.
Second, we examine Commission precedent. Third, we examine public policy and our goal of benefiting
consumers through greater innovation, investment, and competition. We seek comment on our proposals
and these analyses.
1.

The Text and Structure of the Act

26.
We start with the text of the Act itself. Section 3 of the Act defines an “information
service” as “the offering of a capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing,
retrieving, utilizing, or making available information via telecommunications, and includes electronic

publishing, but does not include any use of any such capability for the management, control, or operation
of a telecommunications system or the management of a telecommunications service.”65 Section 3
defines a “telecommunications service” as “the offering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the
public, or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public, regardless of the
facilities used.”66 Section 3 also defines “telecommunications,” used in each of the prior two definitions,
as “the transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user’s
choosing, without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received.”67
27.
We believe that Internet service providers offer the “capability for generating, acquiring,
storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information via
telecommunications.”68 Whether posting on social media or drafting a blog, a broadband Internet user is
able to generate and make available information online. Whether reading a newspaper’s website or
browsing the results from a search engine, a broadband Internet user is able to acquire and retrieve
information online. Whether it’s an address book or a grocery list, a broadband Internet user is able to
store and utilize information online. Whether uploading filtered photographs or translating text into a
foreign language, a broadband Internet user is able to transform and process information online. In short,
broadband Internet access service appears to offer its users the “capability” to perform each and every one
of the functions listed in the definition—and accordingly appears to be an information service by
definition. We seek comment on this analysis. Can broadband Internet users indeed access these
capabilities? Are there other capabilities that a broadband Internet user may receive with service? If
broadband Internet access service does not afford one of the listed capabilities to users, what effect would
that have on our statutory analysis? More fundamentally, we seek comment on how the Commission
should assess whether a broadband provider is “offering” a capability. Should we asses this from the
perspective of the user, from the provider, or through some other lens?
28.
In the Cable Modem Order, the Commission recognized that broadband Internet users
often used services from third parties: “[S]ubscribers, by ‘click-through’ access, may obtain many
functions from companies with whom the cable operator has not even a contractual relationship. For
example, a subscriber to Comcast’s cable modem service may bypass that company’s web browser,
proprietary content, and email. The subscriber is free to download and use instead, for example, a web
browser from Netscape, content from Fox News, and e-mail in the form of Microsoft’s ‘Hotmail.’”69 It
nonetheless found the classification appropriate “regardless of whether subscribers use all of the functions
provided as part of the service, such as e-mail or web-hosting, and regardless of whether every cable
modem service provider offers each function that could be included in the service.”70 In the Title II
Order, the Commission in turn found that “consumers are very likely to use their high-speed Internet
connections to take advantage of competing services offered by third parties”71 and asserted the service
“is useful to consumers today primarily as a conduit for reaching modular content, applications, and
services that are provided by unaffiliated third parties.”72 We seek comment on how consumers are using
broadband Internet access service today. It appears that, as in 2002 and 2013, broadband Internet users
“obtain many functions from companies” other than their Internet service provider. It also appears that
many broadband Internet users rely on services, such as Domain Name Service (DNS) and email, from

their ISP. Is that correct? If not, what services are broadband Internet users accessing from what
providers? More generally, we seek comment on the relevance of this analysis. The definition of
“information service” speaks to the “capability” to perform certain functions. Is a consumer capable of
accessing these online services without Internet access service? Could a consumer access these online
services using traditional telecommunications services like telephone service or point-to-point special
access73? Or are we correct that offering Internet access is precisely what makes the service capable of
“generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available
information” to consumers?
29.
In contrast, Internet service providers do not appear to offer “telecommunications,” i.e.,
“the transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user’s choosing,
without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received,” to their users. For one,
broadband Internet users do not typically specify the “points” between and among which information is
sent online. Instead, routing decisions are based on the architecture of the network, not on consumers’
instructions, and consumers are often unaware of where online content is stored. Domain names must be
translated into IP addresses (and there is no one-to-one correspondence between the two). Even IP
addresses may not specify where information is transmitted to or from because caching servers store and
serve popular information to reduce network loads. In short, broadband Internet users are paying for the
access to information “with no knowledge of the physical location of the server where that information
resides.”74 We believe that consumers want and pay for these functionalities that go beyond mere
transmission—and that they have come to expect them as part and parcel of broadband Internet access
service. We seek comment on our analysis. How are broadband Internet users’ requests for information
handled by Internet service providers today? What functionalities beyond mere transmission do Internet
service providers incorporate into their broadband Internet access service? We particularly seek comment
on the Title II Order’s assertion that the phrase “points specified by the user” is ambiguous75—how
should we interpret that phrase so that it carries with it independent meaning and is not mere surplusage?
Is it enough, as the Title II Order asserted, for a broadband Internet user to specify the information he is
trying to access but not the “points” between or among which the information will be transmitted? Does
it matter that the Internet service provider specifies the points between and among which information will
be transmitted?76
30.
For another, Internet service providers routinely change the form or content of the
information sent over their networks—for example, by using firewalls to block harmful content or using
protocol processing to interweave IPv4 networks with IPv6 networks. The Commission has
acknowledged that broadband Internet networks must be reasonably managed since at least the 2005
Internet Policy Statement.77 We believe that consumers want and pay for these functionalities that go

In the past, rate-of-return carriers have offered broadband Internet access transmission service as a commoncarriage last-mile service that transmits data between and end user and an ISP. Wireline Broadband Classification
Order, 20 FCC Rcd at 14899–900, paras. 86–88. Absent an ISP at the other end, however, broadband Internet
access transmission service only transmits data to a carrier’s central office (or other aggregation point) as it does not
itself offer the capabilities that come with Internet access.

We note that the Title II Order asserted that “It is not uncommon in the toll-free arena for a single number to route
to multiple locations, and such a circumstance does not transform that service to something other than
telecommunications.” Title II Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 5761–62, para. 361. Despite that assertion, the Commission
has expressly found that the management of toll-free numbers is “not a common carrier service” and that providers
that manage toll-free numbers “do not need to be carriers.” 800 Data Base Access Tariffs and the 800 Service

beyond mere transmission—and that they have come to expect them as part and parcel of broadband
Internet access service. We seek comment on our analysis. What constitutes a “change in the form” of
information? If not the protocol-processing for internetworking—considered an enhanced service under
the Computer Inquiries—how should we interpret this phase so it carries with it independent meaning and
is not mere surplusage? How could we plausibly conclude that it is not a “change in the . . . content” to
use of firewalls and other reasonable network management tools to shield broadband Internet users from
unwanted intrusions and thereby alter what information reaches the user for the user’s benefit? We seek
comment on other ways in which Internet service providers change the form or content of information to
facilitate a broadband Internet user’s experience on line.
31.
Other provisions of the Act appear to confirm our analysis that broadband Internet access
services should be classified as information services. For instance, section 230 defines an interactive
computer service to mean “any information service, system, or access software provider that provides or
enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server, including specifically a service or system
that provides access to the Internet and such systems operated or services offered by libraries or
educational institutions.”78 On its face, the plain language of this provision deems Internet access service
an information service. We seek comment on this analysis, on the language of section 230, and on how it
should impact our classification of broadband Internet access service.
32.
Section 231 is even more direct. It expressly states that “Internet access service” “does
not include telecommunications services.” And it defines Internet access service as one offering many
capabilities (like an information service): “a service that enables users to access content, information,
electronic mail, or other services offered over the Internet, and may also include access to proprietary
content, information, and other services as part of a package of services offered to consumers.”79
Although inserted into the Communications Act one year after the Telecommunications Act’s passage80
and previously interpreted to “clarify that section 231 was not intended to impair our or a state
commission’s ability to regulate basic telecommunications services,”81 this language on its face makes
clear that Internet access service is not a telecommunications service. We seek comment on this analysis,
on the language of section 231, and on how it should impact our classification of broadband Internet
access service.
33.
The structure of Title II appears to be a poor fit for broadband Internet access service. In
the Title II Order, the Commission, on its own motion, forbore either in whole or in part on a permanent
or temporary basis from 30 separate sections of Title II as well as from other provisions of the Act and
Commission rules.82 The significant forbearance the Commission granted in in the Title II Order suggests
the highly prescriptive regulatory framework of Title II is unsuited for the dynamic broadband Internet
access service marketplace. We seek comment on this analysis, and on what weight we should give this
analysis in examining the future of this model of regulation.

broadband Internet access service as an information service. Congress passed the Telecommunications

Act to “promote competition and reduce regulation”83 and “[n]othing in the 1996 Act or its legislative
history suggests that Congress intended to alter the current classification of Internet and other information
services or to expand traditional telephone regulation to new and advanced services.”84 Or as Senator
John McCain put it, “[i]t certainly was not Congress’s intent in enacting the supposedly pro-competitive,
deregulatory 1996 Act to extend the burdens of current Title II regulation to Internet services, which
historically have been excluded from regulation.”85 Or as Congress codified its intent in section 230: It is
the policy of the United States “to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists
for the Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State regulation.”86 An
information service classification would “reduce regulation” and preserve a free market “unfettered by
Federal or State regulation”—but a telecommunications service classification would not. We seek
comment on this analysis, as well as whether there are any other provisions of the Communications Act or
Telecommunications Act that establish congressional intent with respect the appropriate regulatory
framework for broadband Internet access services.
35.
More broadly, we seek comment on the text, structure, and purposes of the
Communications Act and the Telecommunications Act, as well as any additional facts about what Internet
service providers offer, how broadband Internet access service works, and what broadband Internet users
expect that might inform our analysis.
36.
We seek special comment on two aspects of the Title II Order’s interpretation of the Act.
First, the Title II Order claimed its interpretation sprang in part from a change in “broadband providers’
marketing and pricing strategies, which emphasize speed and reliability of transmission separately from
and over the extra features of the service packages they offer.”87 It claimed this marketing “leaves a
reasonable consumer with the impression that a certain level of transmission capability—measured in
terms of ‘speed’ or ‘reliability’—is being offered in exchange for the subscription fee, even if
complementary services are also included as part of the offer.”88 We note that even before the Cable
Modem Order, the Commission recognized that Internet service providers marketed the speed of their
connections.89 We seek comment on whether Internet service providers’ marketing has decidedly
changed in recent decades.90 More generally, we seek comment on the relevance of this argument.
Neither statutory service definition speaks of speed or reliability, and there is little reason to think
consumers might want a fast or reliable “transmission . . . of information” but not a fast or reliable
“capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making
available information.” Indeed, many of the advertisements discussed by the Title II Order speak directly
to the capabilities offered through high-speed service.91 We seek comment on this analysis and on any

other relevant facts regarding whether broadband Internet users receive the capabilities of an information
service or the mere transmission between points of a user’s choosing of a telecommunications service.
37.
Second, the Title II Order found that DNS92 and caching93 used in broadband Internet
access service were just used “for the management, control, or operation of a telecommunications system
or the management of a telecommunications service.”94 The Commission has previously held this
category applies to “adjunct-to-basic” functions that are “incidental” to a telecommunications service’s
underlying use and “do not alter [its] fundamental character.”95 As such, these functions generally are not
“useful to end users, rather than carriers.”96 We seek comment on how DNS and caching functions are
now used, whether they benefit end users, Internet service providers, or both, and whether they fit within
the adjunct-to-basic exception. How would broadband Internet access service work without DNS or
caching? Would removing DNS have a merely incidental effect on broadband Internet users, or would it
fundamentally change their online experience? Absent caching, would broadband Internet users that now
expect high-quality video streaming see only incidental changes or more fundamental changes? Are there
other ways that DNS or caching are used for “for the management, control, or operation of a
telecommunications system”?
2.

Commission Precedent Supports Classification as an Information Service

38.
Our proposed classification of broadband Internet access service as an information
service is firmly rooted in Commission precedent. For two decades, a consistent bipartisan framework
supported a free and open Internet. That same consensus led to six separate Commission decisions
confirming that Internet access service is an information service, subject to Title I. Chairman Kennard
first led the FCC in determining that Internet access service is an information service in the Stevens
Report.97 Chairman Powell led the Commission to classify broadband Internet access service over cable
systems as an information service in the Cable Modem Order.98 Chairman Martin led the Commission to
classify several broadband Internet access services as information services in the Wireline Broadband
Classification Order,99 the BPL-Enabled Broadband Order,100 and the Wireless Broadband Internet
Access Order.101 Finally, Chairman Genachowski declined to reclassify broadband Internet access

Title II Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 5758, para. 356 & n. 972 (defining DNS as services “most commonly used to
translate domain names, [into] numerical IP addresses that are used by network equipment to locate the desired
content”).

from websites that subscribers wish to see most often”).

services in the Open Internet Order.102
39.
We believe the Commission under Democratic and Republican leadership alike was
correct in these decisions to classify broadband Internet access service as an information service and that,
20 years after the passage of the Telecommunications Act, we should be reluctant to second-guess the
interpretations of those more likely to understand the contemporary meaning of the terms of the
Telecommunications Act. We seek comment on our assessment. Did the Commission’s historical
information service classification better enable flexibility in marketplace offerings?103 Did the regulatory
certainty of maintaining the same regulatory environment for approximately three decades (since the
Computer Inquiries) foster additional investment or innovative business models to benefit consumers?
How should we evaluate the prior Commissions’ predictions of intermodal competition given the 4,462
Internet service providers now in the market? How many providers would likely have entered the market
if traditional Title II regulation had been the norm? What actual harms, if any, resulted from light-touch
regulation?
40.
The Commission has previously concluded that Congress formally codified information
services and telecommunications services as two, mutually exclusive types of services in the
Telecommunications Act.104 The Title II Order did not appear to disagree with this analysis, finding that
broadband Internet access service was a telecommunications service and not an information service.105
We believe this conclusion regarding mutual exclusivity is correct based on the text and history of the
Act. We seek comment on this analysis.
41.
The Commission has previously found that Congress intended the definitions of
information service and telecommunications service in the Act to parallel those definitions in the MFJ and
in the Computer Inquiries.106 The Title II Order apparently accepted these parallels.107 We thus seek
comment on any evidence that the court in the MFJ thought that Internet access service was a
telecommunications service. Did the court and the Department of Justice intend to exclude Internet
access services from the prohibitions on what Bell Operating Companies could offer? Did the court and
the Department of Justice intend for Internet access services to be regulated via tariff (as other
telecommunications services were)? We similarly seek comment on any evidence that the Commission in
the Computer Inquiries thought that Internet access service was a basic service. Did the Commission
intend for facilities-based carriers to offer Internet access service without the protections of the Computer
Inquiries (as they could for basic services)? The Supreme Court has said that statutory interpretation
“must be guided to a degree by common sense as to the manner in which Congress is likely to delegate a
policy decision of such economic and political magnitude to an administrative agency.”108 How is that
canon relevant here?
42.

Finally, the Title II Order deviated further from Commission precedent to extend its

Open Internet Order, 25 FCC Rcd at 17933, paras. 47-48.

103

See, e.g., Wireline Broadband Internet Access Services Order, 20 FCC Rcd at 14891-92, para. 72 (eliminating the
Computer Inquiries requirement to offer broadband transmission on a common carrier basis “will make it more
likely that wireline network operators will take more risks in investing in and deploying new technologies than they
are willing and able to take under the existing regime”); Stevens Report, 13 FCC Rcd at 11524, para. 46 (“the

development of the enhanced-services industry”).

authority to Internet traffic exchange or “interconnection,”109 an area historically unregulated and beyond
the Commission’s reach. We believe Internet traffic exchange, premised on privately negotiated
agreements or case-by-case basis, is not a telecommunications service. Moreover, we find nothing in the
Act that would extend our jurisdiction as previously suggested by the Title II Order. We further do not
believe there exists any non-Title II basis for the Commission to exercise ongoing regulatory oversight
over Internet traffic exchange. We accordingly propose to relinquish any authority over Internet traffic
exchange. We seek comment on the consequences and implications of the relinquishing the
Commission’s regulatory authority in this manner.
43.
We note that the Commission’s Title II Order also went well beyond agency precedent in
important ways. For instance, the Commission did not limit its analysis to the “last mile” connections at
issue in the Brand X and the FCC’s underlying proceeding in that case. Rather, the Commission’s Title II
Order defined Internet access service as extending far deeper into the network. We seek comment on the
significance of this expansive departure from agency precedent.
3.

Public Policy Supports Classification as an Information Service

44.
The Commission’s decision to reclassify broadband Internet access service as a
telecommunications service subject to Title II regulation has resulted in negative consequences for
American consumers—including depressed broadband investment and reduced innovation because of
increased regulatory burdens and regulatory uncertainty stemming from the rules adopted under Title II.
As providers have devoted more resources to complying with new regulations, the threat of regulatory
enforcement of vague rules and standards has dampened providers’ incentive to invest and innovate.
Additionally, although reclassifying broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service
has led to significant regulatory burdens, it has not solved any discrete, identifiable problems. Restoring
broadband Internet access service to its previous status as an information service subject to Title I is in the
public interest because it will alleviate the harms caused by Title II reclassification. We seek detailed
comment on this analysis below.
45.
Following the 2014 Notice and in the lead up to the Title II Order, Internet service
providers stated that the increased regulatory burdens of Title II classification would lead to depressed
investment.110 Recent data indicate how accurate those predictions were. A recent study indicates that
capital expenditure from the nation’s twelve largest Internet service providers has fallen by $3.6 billion, a
5.6% decline relative to 2014 levels.111 Another study indicated that between 2011 and 2015, the threat of
reclassification reduced telecommunications investment by about 20–30%, or about $30–40 billion

annually.112 Other sources also explain that other countries’ experiences should caution the United States
that ongoing utility-style regulation should be expected to have even more dramatic impacts on
investment beyond what has already occurred.113 Other interested parties have come to different
conclusions.114
46.
We believe that these reduced expenditures are a direct and unavoidable result of Title II
reclassification, and exercise our predictive judgment that reversing the Title II classification and
restoring broadband Internet access service to a Title I service will increase investment. Among other
things, Internet service providers have finite resources, and requiring providers to divert some of those
resources to newly imposed regulatory requirements adopted under Title II will, unsurprisingly, reduce
expenditures that benefit consumers. We seek comment on how the burdens associated with Title II
regulation have impacted broadband investment and, as a result, consumers. Has the Commission’s
increased regulation of broadband adversely impacted broadband investment and innovation? What
impact has Title II reclassification had on providers’ business models, including any lost opportunity
costs, and how has this impact has been passed on to consumers? Is there any evidence that increased
regulation has promoted broadband investment, as some claim? What are the long-term implications of
utility-style regulation respect to capital expenditures on high-speed networks?
47.
We also seek specific comment on how the classification of broadband Internet access
service as a telecommunications service has impacted smaller broadband Internet access service
providers, many of whom lack the dedicated compliance staffs and financial resources of the nation’s
largest providers. Before the Commission adopted the Title II Order, many small providers made it clear
that reclassification would harm their businesses and the customers they serve.115 Since reclassification,
small providers have been forced to reduce their investment and halt the expansion of their networks, and
slow, if not delay the development and deployment of innovative new offerings.116 For example, one

Commission’s reclassification decision had for to put those plans on hold.117 Other small providers have
had to modify or abandon altogether past business models to account for increased compliance costs and
depressed investment from outside investors.118 This depressed investment has had particularly strong
impacts on the deployment of broadband to previously unserved and rural areas.119 What other impacts
have small providers felt as a result of reclassification? Have there been any corresponding benefits for
small providers?
48.
In addition to imposing significant regulatory costs on Internet service providers, Title II
reclassification created significant regulatory uncertainty. USTelecom specifically identified “regulatory
uncertainty” as one of the causes of reduced investment.120 Regulatory uncertainty may have particularly
significant effects on small Internet service providers, which may be poorly equipped to address the legal,
technical, and financial burdens associated with an uncertain regulatory environment.121 That uncertainty
has directly led to reduced investment, which has harmed consumers.122 We seek comment on what other
effects regulatory uncertainty has had on broadband Internet access service providers’ investment

services to utility-style regulation. We note that increased investment is likely to lead to a faster closing
of the digital divide for rural and low-income consumers, higher speeds and more competition for all
consumers, as well as more affordable prices. We seek comment on the magnitude of these effects, and
what further steps the Commission should take to maximize facilities-based investment and competition.
Specifically, we seek comment on the trade-offs from changing the classification status. We also seek
comment more broadly on the effects on innovation of regulatory uncertainty, and other examples of
reduced innovation from Internet service providers as a result of the Title II classification.
50.
We also seek comment on specific ways in which consumers were harmed under the
light-touch regulatory framework that existed before the Commission’s Title II Order. Much of the Title
II Order focused extensively on hypothetical actions Internet service providers “might” take, and how
those actions “might” harm consumers,123 but the Title II Order only articulated four examples of actions
Internet service providers arguably took to justify its adoption of the Internet conduct standard under Title
II.124 Do these isolated examples justify the regulatory shift that Title II reclassification entailed? Do
such isolated examples constitute market failure sufficient to warrant pre-emptive, industry-wide
regulation? Were pre-existing federal and state competition and consumer protection regimes, in addition
to private sector initiatives, insufficient to address such isolated examples, and if so, why? What are the
costs and benefits of pre-emptive, industry-wide regulation in such circumstances? In particular, does
that approach deter competition and competitive entry, and does it have unintended consequences with
respect to infrastructure investment? Do those unintended consequences outweigh any purported benefits
in addressing such isolated cases pre-emptively? Is there evidence of actual harm to consumers sufficient
to support maintaining the Title II telecommunications service classification for broadband Internet access
service? Is there any evidence that the likelihood of these events occurring decreased with the shift to
Title II?
51.
Conversely, what, if any, changes have been made as a result of Title II reclassification
that have had a positive impact on consumers? Was Title II reclassification necessary for any of those
changes to occur? Is there any evidence, for example, that consumers’ online experiences and Internet
access have improved due to policies adopted in the Title II Order?

The Commission has Legal Authority to Classify Broadband Internet Access
Service as an Information Service

52.
As the D.C. Circuit has held, “[i]t is axiomatic that administrative agencies may issue
regulations only pursuant to authority delegated to them by Congress.”125 And that authority is not
unbounded. The Commission has authority, as the Supreme Court recognized in Brand X, to interpret the
Communications Act, including ambiguous definitional provisions.126 However, when interpreting a
statute it administers, the Commission, like all agencies, “must operate ‘within the bounds of reasonable
interpretation.’ And reasonable statutory interpretation must account for both ‘the specific context in
which . . . language is used’ and ‘the broader context of the statute as a whole.’”127
See, e.g., Title II Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 5652, para. 121 (“the no-blocking rule will not be as effective because
broadband providers might otherwise engage in conduct that harms the open Internet but falls short of outright
blocking”); at 5656, para. 127 (“because of the very real concerns about the chilling effects that preferential
treatment arrangements could have on the virtuous cycle of innovation, consumer demand, and investment, we adopt
a bright-line rule banning paid prioritization arrangements”).

53.
An agency also is free to change its approach to interpreting and implementing a statute
so long as it acknowledges that it is doing so and justifies the new approach.128 Evaluating the change in
regulatory approach in the Title II Order, the D.C. Circuit majority in USTelecom applied a “highly
deferential standard” to the agency’s predictive judgments regarding the investment effects of
reclassification,129 and deferred to the Commission’s “‘evaluat[ion of] complex market conditions’”
underlying its rejection of providers’ reliance interests in the prior classification.130 D.C. Circuit
precedent also recognizes, however, that should the Commission’s predictions “prove erroneous, the
Commission will need to reconsider” the associated regulatory actions “in accordance with its continuing
obligation to practice reasoned decision-making.”131 We believe that the Commission’s predictions and
expectations regarding broadband investment and the nature and effects of reclassification on the
operation of the marketplace were mistaken and have not been borne out by subsequent events.
Moreover, we believe that a restoration of the information-service classification for broadband Internet
access service is likely to increase infrastructure investment. In such a case, principles of administrative
law give us more than ample latitude to revisit our approach. We seek comment on this overall approach,
and we seek comment on these specific issues in the sections below.
54.
Even more fundamentally, we believe that the Commission’s statutory interpretation in
the Title II Order did not adequately reflect proper standards of statutory construction, and that classifying
broadband Internet access service as an information service is the better reading of the statute,
independent of the factual developments subsequent to the Title II Order. We note that the Supreme
Court has expressly upheld the Commission’s prior information service classification.132 We seek
comment on this analysis. Although the Title II Order’s telecommunications service classification was
upheld in USTelecom, the court emphasized that it “‘sit[s] to resolve only legal questions presented and
argued by the parties,’” and not “‘arguments a party could have made but did not.’”133 Many arguments
as to why an information service classification of broadband Internet access service reflects the better
reading of ambiguous provisions of the Act were not addressed by the court because the arguments were
raised in support of a claim that the Act unambiguously required a particular service classification.134
Thus, although we are in any case free to revisit previously affirmed interpretations of ambiguous
statutory language, we note that the USTelecom decision did not reach many aspects of the statutory
analysis we propose here. We seek comment on this analysis and on our reasoning that the statutory

interpretation proposed in this Notice more faithfully adheres to the Act and reflects the better reading of

B.

Reinstating the Private Mobile Service Classification of Mobile Broadband Internet
Access Service

55.
We propose to classify all broadband Internet access services—both fixed and mobile—
as information services. With respect to mobile broadband Internet access service, we further propose to
return it to its original classification as a private mobile service, and in conjunction to revisit the elements
of the Title II Order that modified or reinterpreted key terms in section 332 of the Act and our
implementing rules. We seek comment on that proposal, including on the specific issues discussed
below. We also generally seek comment on whether certain and, if so, which, aspects of the D.C.
Circuit’s analysis of mobile broadband Internet access service in USTelecom necessitate modifications or
additions to the Commission’s proposals with respect to mobile broadband Internet access service here.135
56.
We propose to restore the meaning of “public switched network” under section 332(d)(2)
to its pre-Title II Order focus on the traditional public switched telephone network.136 We find persuasive
the Commission’s reasoning when originally adopting the prior definition,137 which also appears more
consistent with the historical usage of the term “public switched network,”138 appears to better accord
with the text of section 332(d)(2) by clearly covering only a single, integrated network,139 and was not
disturbed by Congress in amendments to section 332 of the Act.140 We seek comment on this analysis
and our proposed approach.
57.
We also propose to return to our prior definition of “interconnected service” by restoring
the word “all” in the codified definition.141 Although the court in USTelecom found the deletion of “all”
to be “of no consequence” to the reclassification of mobile broadband Internet access service, it did so
based on an argument that the Commission never mentioned in its brief—namely, that mobile broadband
users can reach telephone customers “via VoIP” and that this determination is sufficient (regardless of the
deletion of the word “all”) to render mobile broadband Internet access service interconnected with the
public switched network.142 We seek comment on that view and whether the Commission erred in 2015
by modifying the definition based on the view that two separate networks can be interconnected if they do
not allow all users to communicate with each other. The FCC’s prior decision in this respect appears to
run contrary to the focus on a single, integrated network that we believe Congress likely intended in

section 332(d)(2).143 We seek comment on these views. In the Title II Order, the Commission noted that
the prior definition of “interconnected service” would encompass a service that “provides general access
to points on the PSN [but] also restricts calling in certain limited ways” (such as blocking of 900
numbers), but cited no evidence that the prior definition led to any confusion.144 We question the need for
changes to the prior definition to account for that nuance, but nonetheless seek comment on whether
modified rule language is warranted, and if so, what language targeted narrowly to that issue should be
incorporated.
58.
We also seek comment on whether any other interpretations of section 332 or our
implementing rules from the Title II Order should be revisited here in connection with our proposed
classification of mobile broadband Internet access service. For example, would a narrower interpretation
of “capability” for purposes of the definition of “interconnected service” under our rules be warranted
based on the Act or the regulatory history of that language? Are there other interpretations that should be
reconsidered? In addition to the changes to the definitions in section 20.3 of the rules discussed above,
would any additional changes to our codified rules be warranted?
59.
In applying the definitions and interpretations of key terms in section 332 and our
implementing rules under the proposals above, we also propose to reach the same conclusions regarding
the application of those terms to mobile broadband Internet access service as we did in the Wireless
Broadband Order.145 We seek comment on that proposal and whether there have been any material
changes in technology, the marketplace, or other facts that would warrant refinement or revision of any of
that analysis.
60.
Furthermore, insofar as mobile broadband Internet access service is best interpreted to be
an information service, we believe that likely also would counsel in favor of classifying it as a private
mobile service to avoid the inconsistency of the service being both an information service and a common
carrier service. The Commission explained this reasoning when originally classifying mobile broadband
Internet access service as both an information service and a private mobile service, and we propose to
apply that same reasoning again here.146 We seek comment on this proposal.
61.
We also tentatively conclude that mobile broadband Internet access service is not the
“functional equivalent” of commercial mobile service, and seek comment on that view. The Commission
previously has observed, in light of Congress’s determinations in section 332, that “very few mobile
services that do not meet the definition of CMRS will be a close substitute for a commercial mobile radio
service.”147 By contrast, we are concerned that the Title II Order’s test, which focuses on whether the
service merely “enables ubiquitous access to the vast majority of the public,” would eviscerate the
statutory scheme.148 We believe that the standard for demonstrating functional equivalency under our
rules is instead more likely to properly implement section 332(d)(3) of the Act, and we thus propose to

Had all the elements of the Title II Order’s mobile broadband Internet access service classification remained, a
future Commission might have incentives to adopt such an approach to avoid the potentially absurd result that
traditional wireless voice service no longer constituted commercial mobile service. While not finding it a sufficient
basis to reject the Title II Order’s treatment of mobile broadband Internet access service, the D.C. Circuit
acknowledged the possibility that the revised definition of public switched network raised questions about whether
traditional wireless voice service was sufficiently interconnected with the public switched network to still constitute
a commercial mobile service. See USTelecom, 825 F.3d at 722.

reconsider the Title II Order’s position that the Commission is free to depart from that standard.149 In
addition, the Title II Order made no claim that the functional equivalency standard in our rules was met
by mobile broadband Internet access service, and we similarly propose here that it does not meet that
standard. We seek comment on these proposals.
62.
Given the apparent historical success of the wireless marketplace prior to the Title II
Order, we anticipate that returning mobile broadband Internet access service to its original classification
of private mobile service and restoring prior definitions and interpretations of key concepts in section 332
is likely to substantially benefit the wireless marketplace and consumers and have few, if any, policy
disadvantages. We seek comment on this view. To the extent any commenters believe that these
proposals will have negative policy consequences, we seek specific information regarding the scope or
significance of any such consequences and whether they can be mitigated in whole or in part through
modifications to our proposals.
C.

Effects on Regulatory Structures Created by the Title II Order

63.
The Title II Order imposed additional regulatory frameworks under Title II, including
forbearance and privacy. We seek comment on how we should treat those structures and proceedings
moving forward.
64.
Forbearance. If we adopt our lead proposal to remove the Title II reclassification of
broadband Internet access service, what effect does that action have on the provisions of the Act from
which the Commission forbore in the Title II Order? We believe that restoring the classification status of
broadband Internet access service to an information service will render any additional forbearance moot
in most cases. We seek comment on this analysis. At the same time, we seek comment on whether, with
respect to broadband Internet access service, the Commission should maintain and extend forbearance to
even more provisions of Title II as a way of further ensuring that our decision in this proceeding will
prove to reduce regulatory burdens.
65.
We also seek comment on the effect of reinstating an information service classification
on providers that voluntarily offered broadband transmission on a common carrier basis under the
Wireline Broadband Classification Order framework.150 The Title II Order allowed such providers to
opt-in to the Title II Order’s forbearance framework.151 Should providers voluntarily electing to offer
broadband transmission on a common carrier basis be able to do so under the Title II Order’s forbearance
framework if we reclassify broadband Internet access service as an information service? If not, what
transition mechanisms are required for such providers that opted-in to the Title II Order’s forbearance
framework to enable them to revert back to the Wireline Broadband Classification Order framework?
Should we extend forbearance to any other rules or statutory provisions for carriers that choose to offer
broadband transmission on a common carrier basis?
66.
Section 222 Regulations. Historically, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) protected
the privacy of broadband consumers, policing every online company’s privacy practices consistently and
initiating numerous enforcement actions.152 When the Commission reclassified broadband Internet access
service as a common carriage telecommunications service in 2015, however, that action stripped FTC
authority over Internet service providers because the FTC is prohibited from regulating common

carriers.153 To address the gap created by the Commission’s reclassification of broadband Internet access
service as a common carriage service, the Title II Order called for a new rulemaking to apply section
222’s customer proprietary network information provisions to Internet service providers.154 In October
2016, the Commission adopted rules governing Internet service provider’s privacy practices and applied
the rules it adopted to other providers of telecommunications services.155 In March 2017, Congress voted
under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to disapprove the Commission’s 2016 Privacy Order, which
prevents us from adopting rules in substantially the same form.156
67.
We propose to return jurisdiction over Internet service providers’ privacy practices to the
FTC, with its decades of experience and expertise in this area.157 We seek comment on this proposal.
68.
Lifeline. We propose to maintain support for broadband in the Lifeline program after
reclassification. In the Universal Service Transformation Order, the Commission recognized that
“[s]ection 254 grants the Commission the authority to support not only voice telephony service but also
the facilities over which it is offered”158 and “allows us to . . . require carriers receiving federal universal
service support to invest in modern broadband-capable networks.”159 Accordingly, as the Commission
did in the Universal Service Transformation Order, we propose requiring Lifeline carriers to use Lifeline
support “for the provision, maintenance, and upgrading” of broadband facilities capable of providing
supported services.160 We seek comment on this proposal. We also seek comment on any rule changes
necessary to effectuate this change in our underlying authority to support broadband for low-income
individuals and families.
69.
Other. Beyond the issues raised above, we seek comment on the impact of
reclassification on other Commission proceedings and proposals. For instance, how should we take into
account our proposed reclassification in our proposals with respect to pole attachments and our inquiries

See 15 U.S.C. §§ 45(a)(2) (exempting “common carriers subject to the Acts to regulate commerce”), 44 (defining
“Acts to regulate commerce” as including “the Communications Act of 1934 and all Acts amendatory thereof and
supplementary thereto”); 47 U.S.C. § 153(51) (providing that “[a] telecommunications carrier shall be treated as a
common carrier under [the Communications Act] only to the extent that it is engaged in providing
telecommunications services”). One Ninth Circuit case has held that the common carrier exemption precluded FTC
oversight of BIAS providers that otherwise were common carriers with respect to non-BIAS services. See FTC v.
AT&T Mobility LLC, 835 F.3d 993 (9th Cir. 2016). The FTC has sought rehearing of that case en banc, which the
Commission has supported. See Amicus Curiae Brief of the Federal Communications Commission In Support of the
Federal Trade Commission’s Petition For Rehearing En Banc, FTC v. AT&T Mobility LLC, No. No. 3:14-cv-04785EMC (9th Cir. filed Oct. 24, 2016); Letter Pursuant to Fed R. App. P 28(j) of amicus FCC, FTC v. AT&T Mobility
LLC, No. 15-16585 (9th Cir. Apr. 21, 2017). To the extent that issue ultimately were resolved favorably for the
FTC, the Commission’s reclassification of broadband Internet access service as a common carrier would remain a
constraint on the extent to which the FTC could oversee the conduct of Internet service providers.

how we can leverage our proposed reclassification in other proceedings to further encourage broadband
deployment to all Americans.
IV.

A LIGHT-TOUCH REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

70.
Proposing to restore broadband Internet access service to its long-established
classification as an information service reflects our commitment to a free and open Internet. Indeed, our
lead proposal reaffirms the long-standing, bipartisan consensus begun in the Clinton Administration by
restoring the Internet to the dynamic state that allowed it to flourish prior to the Title II Order. To
determine how to best honor our commitment to restoring the free and open Internet, we propose reevaluating the Commission’s existing rules and enforcement regime to analyze whether ex ante regulatory
intervention in the market is necessary. To the extent we decide to retain any of the Commission’s ex
ante regulations, we seek comment on whether, and how, we should modify them, specifically
considering different approaches such as self-governance or ex post enforcement that may effectuate our
goals better than across-the-board rules. Finally, we discuss the Commission’s legal authority to adopt
rules governing Internet service provider practices.
A.

Re-evaluating the Existing Rules and Enforcement Regime

71.
Below, we explore the best method to restore the long-standing consensus under both
Democratic and Republican-led Commissions, represented by the four Internet Freedoms, that consumers
should have access to the content, applications, and devices of their choosing as well as meaningful
information about their service, all without deterring the investment and innovation that has allowed the
Internet to flourish. We examine these freedoms and the Commission’s current rules related to them, and
for each, ask whether we should keep, modify, or eliminate them.
1.

Eliminating the Internet Conduct Standard

72.
In the Title II Order, the Commission created a catch-all standard intended to prohibit
“current or future practices that cause the type of harms [the Commission’s] rules are intended to
address.”163 This standard allows the Commission to prohibit practices that it determines unreasonably
interfere with or unreasonably disadvantage the ability of consumers to reach the Internet content,
services, and applications of their choosing or of online content, applications and service providers to
access consumers.164 This standard also gives the Commission discretion to prohibit any Internet service
provider practice that it believes violates any one of the non-exhaustive list of factors adopted in the Title
II Order.165
73.
We propose eliminating this Internet conduct standard and the non-exhaustive list of
factors intended to guide application of the rule, and we seek comment on this proposal. What are the

effect on innovation, investment, or broadband deployment; free expression, application/use-agnostic; and standard
practices).

costs of the present Internet conduct standard and implementing factors? Do the standard and its
implementing factors provide carriers with adequate notice of what they are and are not allowed to do?166
Does the standard benefit consumers in any way and, if so, how? We believe that eliminating the Internet
conduct standard will promote network investment and service-related innovation by eliminating the
uncertainty caused by vague and undefined regulation. Do commenters agree?
74.
Because the Internet conduct standard is premised on theoretical problems that will be
adjudicated on an individual, case-by-case basis, Internet service providers must guess at what they are
permitted and not permitted to do.167 The now-retracted so-called Zero Rating Report issued by the
Wireless Telecommunications Bureau illustrates the dilemma providers experience under a Title II
regulatory regime.168 After a thirteen-month investigation, the Report did not specifically call for an end
to any provider’s practices or identify any particular harm from offering consumers free data. Instead, it
stated that the free-data plans “may raise” economic and public policy issues that “may harm consumers
and competition.”169 It then reiterated that any determination about the harm from free data offerings
would be made by the Commission on a “case-by-case” basis, using a “non-exhaustive list of factors.”170
Instead of giving providers clear rules of the road to govern future conduct, this report put a provider on
notice that an enforcement action could be just around the corner. The report, and the investigation that
preceded it, left Internet service providers with two options: either wait for a regulatory enforcement
action that could arrive at some unspecified future point or stop providing consumers with innovative
offerings. We seek comment on whether this roaming mandate has impacted innovation, and what impact
that has had on consumers. We seek comment on whether eliminating this vague standard will spur
innovation and benefit consumers.
75.
We propose not to adopt any alternatives to the Internet conduct rule, and we seek
comment on this proposal. Is there a need for any general non-discrimination standard in today’s Internet
marketplace? If so, what would that general non-discrimination standard be? The 2014 Notice proposed
prohibiting “commercially unreasonable practices.”171 Should we consider that alternative? Or should
we consider another general rule and framework (such as Commission adjudication of non-discrimination
complaints)? If we adopt our proposals to eliminate the Internet conduct standard and not to adopt any
alternative general requirement, we seek comment on how we can encourage innovative business models
that give consumers more choices and lower prices while also promoting consumer freedom on the
Internet.
2.

Determining the Need for the Bright Line Rules and the Transparency Rule

76.
In the Title II Order, despite virtually no quantifiable evidence of consumer harm, the
Commission nevertheless determined that it needed bright line rules banning three specific practices by
providers of both fixed and mobile broadband Internet access service: blocking, throttling, and paid
Id. at 5659, para. 135 (stating that the Commission could investigate and prohibit “on a case-by-case basis,
practices that unreasonably interfere with or unreasonably disadvantage the ability of consumers to reach the
Internet content, services, and applications of their choosing or of edge providers to access consumers using the
Internet”); Zero Rating Report at 3–5 (setting out 16 discrete criteria the Commission could use to evaluate offerings
on a case-by-case basis).
166

See Letter from 22 Small ISPs at 2 (asserting that the general conduct rules is “so vague and open-ended that we
are concerned that the Commission would invoke it to sanction conduct for which we have no advance warning”).

prioritization.172 The Commission also “enhanced” the transparency rule by adopting additional
disclosure requirements.173 Today, we revisit these determinations and seek comment on whether we
should keep, modify, or eliminate the bright line and transparency rules.
77.
At the outset of our review of the Commission’s existing rules, we seek comment on
whether ex ante regulatory intervention in the market is necessary in the broadband context. Beyond the
few, scattered anecdotes cited by the Title II Order, have there been additional, concrete incidents that
threaten the four Internet Freedoms sufficient to warrant adopting across-the-board rules? Is there any
evidence of market failure, or is there likely to be, sufficient to warrant pre-emptive, comprehensive
regulation? How have marketplace developments impacted the incentive and ability, if any, of broadband
Internet access service providers to engage in conduct that is contrary to the four Internet Freedoms?
Must we find that market power exists to retain rules in this space, and if so must the rules only apply to
providers that have market power? Further, should any approach we adopt—whether ex ante rules,
expectations regarding industry self-governance, or ex post enforcement practices—vary based on the
size, financial resources, customer base of the broadband Internet access service provider, and/or other
factors? Specifically, we seek comment on whether rules are necessary for or burdensome on smaller
providers.
78.
The Commission partially justified the 2015 rules on the theory that the rules would
prevent anti-competitive behavior by broadband Internet access providers’ seeking to advantage affiliated
content.174 With the existence of antitrust regulations aimed at curbing various forms of anticompetitive
conduct, such as collusion and vertical restraints under certain circumstances, we seek comment on
whether these rules are unnecessary in light of these other regulatory regimes.175 Could the continued
existence of these rules negatively impact future innovative, pro-competitive business deals that would
not by themselves run afoul of merger conditions or established antitrust law?
79.
Need for the No-Blocking Rule. We emphasize that we oppose blocking lawful material.
The Commission has repeatedly found the need for a no-blocking rule on principle, asserting that “the
freedom to send and receive lawful content and to use and provide applications and services without fear
of blocking is essential to the Internet’s openness.”176 We merely seek comment on the appropriate
means to achieve this outcome consistent with the goals of maintaining Internet freedom, maximizing
investment, and respecting the rule of law. We seek comment on whether a codified no-blocking rule is
needed to protect such freedoms. For example, prior to 2015, many large Internet service providers
voluntarily abided by the 2010 no-blocking rule in the absence of a regulatory obligation to do so.177 Do
we have reason to think providers would behave differently today if the Commission were to eliminate

the no-blocking rule? Is the no-blocking rule is necessary for or burdensome on smaller providers?
80.
We seek comment on the continuing need for a no-blocking rule. The no-blocking rule,
originally adopted in 2010, invalidated by the Verizon court, and re-adopted in the Title II Order,
prohibits Internet service providers from blocking competitors’ content by mandating that a customer has
a right to access lawful content, applications, services, and to use non-harmful devices, subject to
reasonable network management.178
81.
If we determine that a no-blocking rule is indeed necessary to ensure a free, open, and
dynamic Internet, what are the best means to achieve this outcome consistent with the goals of
maintaining Internet freedom and maximizing investment? Should we consider modifying the existing
no-blocking rule to better align with our proposed legal classification of broadband Internet access service
as an information service? The Verizon court made clear that the Commission’s 2010 no-blocking rule
impermissibly subjected Internet service providers to common-carriage regulation.179 We seek comment
on whether there are other formulations of a no-blocking rule that are consistent with our proposed legal
classification of broadband Internet access service as an information service and for which we would have
legal authority.
82.
Need for the No-Throttling Rule. In the Title II Order, the Commission concluded that
throttling was a sufficiently severe and distinct threat that it required its own, separate, codified rule.180
The no-throttling rule mirrors the no-blocking rule and bans the impairment or degradation of lawful
Internet traffic or use of a non-harmful device, subject to reasonable network management practices.181
We seek comment on whether this rule is still necessary, particularly for smaller providers. How does the
rule benefit consumers, and what are its costs? When is “throttling” harmful to consumers? Does the nothrottling rule prevent providers from offering broadband Internet access service with differentiated
prioritization that benefits consumers? Does the no-throttling rule harm latency-sensitive applications and
content? Does it prevent product differentiation among broadband Internet access service providers? If
we eliminate the no-blocking rule, should we also eliminate the no-throttling rule? If we determine that a
no-throttling rule is indeed necessary to ensure a free, open, and dynamic Internet, are there ways in
which we could modify the no-throttling rule so it aligns with our proposed legal classification of
broadband Internet access service as an information service and for which we would have legal authority?
83.
The Commission justified the separate, codified no-throttling rule on the theory of
preventing anti-competitive behavior for broadband Internet access providers’ affiliated content.182 With
the existence of antitrust and other regulations aimed at curbing collusion, we seek comment on whether a
no-throttling rule is duplicative of these other regulatory regimes.183 Could the continued existence of this

rule negatively impact future innovative, pro-competitive business deals that would not by themselves run
afoul of merger conditions or established antitrust law?
84.
Need for the No Paid Prioritization Rule. The Commission concluded in the Title II
Order that “fast lanes” or “paid prioritization” practices “harm consumers, competition, and innovation,
as well as create disincentives to promote broadband deployment.”184 The Commission adopted this ex
ante flat ban on individual negotiations to address an apparently nonexistent problem. The ban on paid
prioritization did not exist prior to the Title II Order and even then the record evidence confirmed that no
such rule was needed since several large Internet service providers made it clear that that they did not
engage in paid prioritization185 and had no plans to do so.186 We seek comment on the continued need for
such a rule and our authority to retain it.
85.
What are the trade-offs in banning business models dependent on paid prioritization
versus allowing them to occur when overseen by a regulator or industry actors? Is there a risk that
banning paid prioritization suppresses pro-competitive activity? For example, could allowing paid
prioritization give Internet service providers a supplemental revenue stream that would enable them to
offer lower-priced broadband Internet access service to end-users? What would be the impacts on new
startups and innovation? Does a no-paid-prioritization rule harm the development of real-time or
interactive services?187 Could allowing paid prioritization enable certain critical information, such as
consumers’ health care vital signs that are being monitored remotely, to be transmitted more efficiently or
reliably? What other considerations mitigate any potential negative impacts from business models like
paid prioritization? Should the Commission impose restrictions on these business models at all?
86.
We seek comment on current traffic delivery arrangements online. How do content,
application, and service providers host their data online? Do they rely on installing their own servers in
data centers, content delivery networks, or cloud-based hosting? What are the varying service
characteristics of these options and their varying costs? It appears that some larger online content
providers like Netflix host their own data centers and interconnect directly with Internet service
providers.188 Is that still true? What are the service characteristics and costs of this option? How should
the existence of these arrangement impact our evaluation of whether Internet service providers should be
able to offer an alternative delivery option such paid prioritization?
87.
For those parties that believe an ex ante flat ban on paid prioritization is necessary, are
there other formulations of a no-paid-prioritization rule that are consistent with our proposed legal
classification of broadband Internet access service as an information service and for which we would have
legal authority? Are there any other formulations that are consistent with allowing pro-competitive or
pro-consumer paid prioritization arrangements? Would we need to modify the rule and, if so, how?
88.
Need for the Transparency Rule. We seek comment on whether to keep, modify, or
eliminate the transparency rule.189 When the Commission adopted the transparency rule in 2010 and
enhanced it in 2015, it found that “effective disclosure of Internet service providers’ network management
practices, performance, and commercial terms of service promotes competition, innovation, investment,

end-user choice, and broadband adoption.”190 We continue to support these objectives and seek comment
on whether the existing transparency rule is the best way to accomplish them, or if there are other
methods we can employ to achieve the goals of competition, innovation, investment, end-user choice, and
broadband adoption.
89.
Although we agree that the disclosure requirements were among some of the least
intrusive regulatory measures imposed by the Title II Order,191 we seek comment on whether the
additional reporting obligations from that rule remains necessary in today’s competitive broadband
marketplace. What are the benefits and drawbacks of those additional reporting obligations? Is the
length of time necessary to obtain approval of these rules, first adopted in February 2015 and yet not
going into effect until nearly two years later, illustrative of just how burdensome the new enhancements
are in comparison to the 2010 rule?192 Would the original transparency rule, which has been continuously
operational since it came into effect following adoption of the Open Internet Order, be sufficient to
protect consumers? Although the Verizon court upheld the 2010 transparency rule, we seek comment on
our authority to retain the 2015 “enhancements” or to modify the transparency rule in a manner distinct
from the Open Internet Order or Title II Order. For example, does the full and accurate disclosure of
service plan information to consumers carry with it most of the benefits of the rule? How often do nonconsumers rely on the additional disclosures required by the transparency rule? Are those additional
benefits worth the additional cost of compliance, especially for small businesses?
90.
Assuming we find a transparency rule necessary, how should we treat the additional
guidance related to the transparency rule? For example, should we continue to enforce guidance from the
Commission’s Chief Technology Officer regarding acceptable methodologies for disclosure of network
performance to satisfy the enhanced transparency rule?193 Is there merit in continuing to promote the
broadband consumer labels that provided ISPs with a safe harbor—or do those standardized notices harm
consumers by preventing them from obtaining additional information?194 Does the repeated need for
advisory guidance following the original 2010 transparency rule indicate that the rule itself is too openended?195

network management adopted in the Title II Order.196 Reasonable network management “allow[s] service
providers the freedom to address legitimate needs such as avoiding network congestion and combating
harmful or illegal content” without running afoul of the rules.197 With respect to the definition of
“reasonable network management,” we seek comment on whether we should eliminate the restriction
imposed by the Title II Order that the exception will only be considered if used for a “technical
management justification rather than other business justifications,”198 or if we should return to the 2010
definition of “reasonable network management” that did not contain that qualifier.199
93.
For the reasonable network management exception and definition of non-broadband
Internet access service data services that fall outside the scope of the rules, we seek comment on how we
should view any additional guidance explaining those terms as set forth in the Title II Order, but not
codified as part of the rules.200 Should we follow the case-by-case approach taken for evaluating
reasonable network management?201 For non-broadband Internet access service data services, should we
adhere to the characteristics of non-broadband Internet access service data services described in the Title
II Order?202 Or, should we revert to the general concept of non-broadband Internet access service data
services discussed in the Open Internet Order (and then known as “specialized services”)? Further, for
non-broadband Internet access service data services, should we eliminate the guidance that if nonbroadband Internet access service data services “are undermining investment, innovation, competition,
and end-user benefits,” then the Commission will take enforcement action—including the particularized
focus on ensuring that “over-the-top services offered over the Internet are not impeded in their ability to
compete with other data services?”203
94.
Application to Mobile. To the extent we keep or modify any of the existing rules, we
seek comment on whether mobile broadband should be treated differently from fixed broadband. The
Title II Order applied the Internet openness rules equally to both fixed and mobile broadband Internet
access services.204 This approach departed from the Open Internet Order’s framework, which adopted a
different no-blocking standard for mobile broadband Internet access service and excluded mobile from

the no unreasonable discrimination rule.205 Are there legal, technical, economic, and/or policy reasons to
distinguish mobile and fixed broadband with respect to rules in this context, and if so how should we
differentiate the two in any rules that we keep or modify? For instance, several mobile providers who
opposed application of the broader rules in 2015 argued that additional rules were unnecessary because
competition for mobile broadband service adequately restrained the behavior of mobile Internet service
providers.206 We seek comment on whether this contention is correct in today’s marketplace.
4.

Enforcement Regime

95.
Should we keep or modify any of the Commission’s existing rules discussed above, we
seek comment on how we should enforce them. In the Open Internet Order the Commission set forth
procedures for filing both informal207 and formal208 complaints. Commission rules currently provide for
filing fees in the case of complaints to enforce Part 8 rules governing broadband Internet access service
and in the case of data roaming complaints.209 Would those rules need to be modified in the event that we
reclassify broadband Internet access service? Could some rules subject to those complaint procedures
remain? Are there other similar issues the Commission would need to address? The Title II Order also
allowed the Enforcement Bureau to issue advisory opinions210 and enforcement advisories,211 and it
created an ombudsperson position to provide effective access to dispute resolution.212 We seek comment
on whether advisory opinions or enforcement advisories have benefitted consumers or broadband Internet
access service providers. If we restore the broadband Internet access service classification to an
information service, should that alter our complaint and enforcement process in this context?
96.
Additionally, we seek comment on streamlining future enforcement processes. For
instance, we propose eliminating the ombudsperson role. Is the role of an ombudsperson necessary to
protect consumer, business, and other organizations’ interests when the Commission has a Bureau—the
Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau (CGB)—dedicated to protecting consumer interests?213 Our
experience suggests that consumers are comfortable working with CGB, and typically did not call on the
ombudsperson specifically. Has the ombudsperson been called to action to assist in circumstances that
otherwise could not have been handled by CGB?
97.
What have been the benefits and drawbacks of the complaint procedures instituted in
2010 and 2015? Since these rules were formally codified in 2010, no formal complaints have been filed
under them. Can we infer that parties heeded the Commission’s encouragement to “resolve disputes
through informal discussions and private negotiations” without Commission involvement, except through
the informal complaint process?214 Does the lack of formal complaints indicate that dedicated, formal
enforcement procedures are unwarranted? If we restore broadband Internet access service’s classification
as an information service, should that alter our complaint and enforcement process in this context? If so,
in what way should the processes be altered? Are there methods other than formal complaints we can

employ to ensure a free and open Internet?
98.
In addition to the enforcement regime, the Title II Order delegated authority to several
Bureaus and Offices to make further decisions involving the rules following their adoption. For example,
the Title II Order delegated authority to the Chief Technologist to provide guidance under the
transparency rule and further delegated authority to several Bureaus to determine whether the safe harbor
disclosures under the transparency rule aligned with the Commission’s expectations.215 If we determine
there is no need for the existing transparency rule or enforcement regime, then we believe that the
technological and safe harbor guidance would become irrelevant. We also believe that the safe harbor
disclosure guidance would be rendered moot. We seek comment on this analysis and on whether there
nonetheless are any affirmative steps the Commission should take with respect either to those delegations
of authority or to actions already taken in reliance on that delegated authority.
B.

Legal Authority to Adopt Rules

99.
We seek comment on the legal authority that the Commission would have in this area if
we adopted our lead proposal to classify broadband Internet access service as an information service.
100.
Section 706. We seek comment on whether section 706(a) and (b) of the 1996 Act are
best interpreted as hortatory rather than as delegations of regulatory authority. Such an interpretation
generally is reflected in the Commission’s approach to section 706 prior to 2010.216 The text of these
provisions also appears more naturally read as hortatory, particularly given the lack of any express grant
of rulemaking authority, authority to prescribe or proscribe the conduct of any party, or to enforce
compliance. Although some courts have held that the Commission’s post-2010 interpretation of section
706(a) and/or (b) as a grant of regulatory authority was not unreasonable, we seek comment on whether
interpreting those provisions as hortatory nonetheless is the better reading.217 Or should we maintain our
post-2010 interpretation of these provisions? Alternatively, we seek comment whether section 706
reflects a “deregulatory bent,”218 and, if so, how we should interpret that with respect to obligations for
regulated entities. If section 706 reflects a deregulatory emphasis, what authority does it give the
Commission, particularly in situations in which capital expenditures by Internet service providers have
slowed, as they have in the past year under Title II regulation? If we interpret section 706(a) as a grant of
authority, does that mean state commission would have coequal authority? If we interpret section 706(b)
as a grant of authority, what would happen to any rules adopted using that authority if the Commission
later found that advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans in a
reasonable and timely fashion? Are there other interpretations of section 706 of the 1996 Act that we
should consider?
101.
Section 230. We also seek comment on whether section 230 gives us the authority to
retain any rules that were adopted in the Title II Order. In Comcast, the D.C. Circuit observed that the

2014) (rejecting arguments that it was unreasonable for the Commission to interpret Section 706(b) as granting

Commission there “acknowledge[d] that section 230(b)” is a “statement [] of policy that [itself]
delegate[s] no regulatory authority.”219 Are there grounds for the Commission to revisit that
interpretation or otherwise invoke section 230 here? For example, the D.C. Circuit in Comcast speculated
that “[p]erhaps the Commission could use section 230(b) . . . to demonstrate . . . a connection” to an
“express statutory delegation of authority,” although it had not done so there.220 If the Commission were
to demonstrate a connection to an express statutory delegation of authority, what would such a
demonstration look like? What, if any, express statutory delegations of authority over broadband Internet
access service exist?
102.
Other Sources of Legal Authority. Should we determine rules are indeed necessary in
this space, we seek comment on any other sources of independent legal authority we might use to support
such rules. For example, we seek comment on the Communications Act authority cited by the
Commission in its Open Internet Order.221 If any other sources of legal authority exist, to what extent
could they be used? And, what are the trade-offs, including the advantages and disadvantages, of using
any of these other sources of legal authority in lieu of Title II provisions that depend on the classification
of BIAS as a telecommunications service and/or section 706 of the 1996 Act?
103.
Constraints on our Legal Authority. The Commission has repeatedly recognized that
adopting rules like these raises constitutional concerns.222 For example, some petitioners in the
USTelecom v. FCC case argued that compelling an Internet service provider to carry all speech violates
the First Amendment.223 Others have argued that “[t]here is no principled basis for distinguishing the
speech of broadband providers from other speakers using older technologies.”224 The D.C. Circuit Court
of Appeals disagreed, finding that “the First Amendment poses no bar to the rules.”225 We seek comment
on whether the First Amendment or any other constitutional provision, or any other federal law, would
constrain the Commission from adopting rules here. If a rule proposes serious constitutional concerns,
how should we modify it? Does the continued classification of broadband Internet access service as a
common-carriage service itself raise any constitutional concerns?
C.

Cost Benefit Analysis

104.
We propose as part of this proceeding to conduct a cost-benefit analysis (CBA). We
propose to compare the costs and the benefits of maintaining the classification of broadband Internet
access service as a telecommunications service (i.e. Title II regulation);226 maintaining the Internet
conduct rule; maintaining the no blocking rule; maintaining the no throttling rule; maintaining the ban on
paid prioritization; maintaining the transparency rules; and acting on the other interpretive and policy
changes for which we seek comment above. We seek comment on how the CBA should be conducted to
appropriately separate or combine the analyses of each piece discussed above. We also seek comment

generally on the importance of conducting a CBA as well as the interaction between the Commission’s
public interest standard and a weighing of the costs and benefits.
105.
Given the size of the economic impacts due to our decisions in this proceeding, it is
especially important to evaluate whether the decision will have net positive benefits. Our presumption is
that the effects of the decision would have an annual effect on the economy of at least $100 million which
is the Federal government’s standard threshold for requiring agencies covered by Executive Order 12866
to conduct a regulatory analysis.227 Executive Order 12866 indicates regulatory actions are economically
significant if they “[h]ave an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in
a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities.”228 While the Commission
is not required by law to comply with this Executive Order, we believe the $100 million threshold
provides a helpful guideline for when a CBA is clearly appropriate.229 We seek comment on our assertion
that conducting a CBA is appropriate and that the decision is likely to be economically significant.
106.
In conducting the CBA, we propose to follow standard practices employed by the federal
government. Specifically we propose to follow the guidelines in Section E (“Identifying and Measuring
Benefits and Costs”) of the Office of Management and Budget’s Circular A-4.230 This publication
provides guidelines which an agency can follow for identifying and quantifying costs and benefits
associated with regulatory decisions while allowing for appropriate latitude in how the analysis is
conducted for a particular regulatory situation. We seek comment on following Circular A-A generally.
We also seek comment on any specific portions of Circular A-4 where the Commission should diverge
from the guidance provided. Commenters should explain why particular guidance in Circular A-4 should
not be followed in this circumstance and should propose alternatives.
107.
Any CBA should be conducted by comparing the costs and benefits relative to the
“baseline” scenario. As OMB Circular A-4 explains, “[t]his baseline should be the best assessment of the
way the world would look absent the proposed action.” Care should be taken to recognize that in certain
cases repealing or eliminating a rule does not result in a total lack of regulation but instead means that
other regulations continue to operate or other regulatory bodies will have authority. For example, as we
evaluate the costs and benefits of maintaining the current classification of broadband Internet access
service as a telecommunications service, the CBA should recognize that changing the classification of
broadband Internet access service to an information service would result in the FTC having jurisdiction
over certain aspects of such services. Therefore, the benefits and costs of the FCC maintaining Title II
jurisdiction over broadband Internet access service should be calculated with FTC enforcement as the
appropriate baseline. In this example, the benefits of maintaining the Commission’s Title II classification
are those benefits that exist over and above the “baseline” scenario of FTC jurisdiction (and FCC Title I
protections). Likewise, the costs of maintaining Title II should be estimated as those costs of ex ante
FCC regulation relative to FTC ex post regulation. We seek comment on the appropriate baseline
scenarios that should be used and on our proposed course of action above.
A “regulatory analysis” has three key components: (1) a statement of the need for a proposed action, (2) an
examinations of alternative approaches, and (3) an evaluation of the benefits and the costs. See Office of
Management and Budget, Circular A-4, https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/circulars_a004_a-4/#a. The
other parts of the Order effectively seek comment on the first and second pieces of the regulatory analysis.
227

228

For entities covered by Executive Order 12866, Regulatory actions deemed economically significant must
undergo review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) and this review will typically require
an accounting of the costs and benefits. See https://www.reginfo.gov/public/jsp/Utilities/faq.jsp.
229

While we believe it is clearly appropriate for actions in excess of $100 million, we make no suggestion here
about whether the Commission should conduct CBAs below that threshold.

108.
In weighing the costs and benefits of any policy, there always exists an element of
uncertainty. As commenters suggest costs and benefits the Commission should consider, we ask that to
the extent possible information could also be provided about the level of certainty surrounding a scenario
or particular value. Also, various costs and benefits are likely to occur at different points in time. When
suggesting costs and benefits, we seek comment on the timing of those costs and benefits.231 We also
seek comment on how uncertainty around and timing of costs and benefits should interact in the analysis.
109.
Costs. There is evidence that the actions taken by the Commission in the Title II Order
have reduced investments by ISPs.232 We presume that maintaining those actions would depress
investment relative to the baseline. Many of the costs of lower or misallocated investment in networks
and in other sectors of the digital economy will be due to consumers and businesses having less
broadband Internet access service coverage and lower quality of service. Since the networks built with
capital investments are only a means to an end, we believe that the private costs borne by consumers and
businesses of maintaining the status quo result from decreased value derived from using the networks.
We seek comment on this analysis. What approaches should we use to capture these costs? We seek
comments on particular methods and data sources we might use to estimate the private costs of forgoing
the building, maintaining, or upgrading of these networks.
110.
In addition to the private costs discussed above, foregone networks may also impose
additional societal costs. In particular, fewer network effects created by increased connectivity will
occur. As another example, society will not realize some efficiencies and savings from governments
delivering services over the networks. Additionally, there are likely long run costs due to forgoing better
connectivity that would allow new products and services to be created. We seek comment on this
analysis. How should our CBA incorporate these types of cost into the analysis? What other ancillary
costs might exist? What data is appropriate to use?
111.
It is also likely that the foregone investment per se results in economic costs (e.g. fewer
network construction jobs), and we seek comment on how the Commission should incorporate any such
these costs into the analysis. For example, should the Commission use a multiplier to account for
economic activity missed due to tempered investment? If so, what are the appropriate multipliers to use?
Commenters should provide sources to justify recommendations for multiplier values.
112.
Lastly, there may be other costs that are not directly the result of decreased investment in
networks. Maintaining current policies may prevent new business models or new product and services
from being viable and ultimately delivering value to society. We seek comment on such costs and how
we may incorporate them into our analysis.
113.
Benefits. There are various theoretical possibilities for economic benefits created by the
current policies. We therefore seek comment on these benefits. Commenters should identify these
benefits relative to an appropriate baseline, not relative to a situation where there is no regulation or
statute to govern behavior. For example, if the ban on paid prioritization is maintained but broadband
Internet access service is classified as an information service, then commenters should identify the
benefits a blanket ban on paid prioritization carries over the FTC’s authority to police anticompetitive
conduct.
114.
We particularly seek comments that attempt to quantify the benefits rather than merely
suggest the existence of benefits without any indication of its magnitude. We also ask commenters to
particularly highlight benefits where actual misconduct has been observed. To the extent the baseline
scenario allows any market failures to go unregulated, commenters should clearly identify the market
231

As explained in OMB Circular A-4, the timing of costs and benefits is important because ultimately the CBA will
need to discount future costs and benefits for the purpose of calculating net present benefits.

PROCEDURAL MATTERS
A.

Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis

115.
As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA),233 the Commission has
prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) for this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, of the
possible significant economic impact on small entities of the policies and rules addressed in this
document. The IRFA is set forth in Appendix B. Written public comments are requested on this IRFA.
Comments must be identified as responses to the IRFA and must be filed on or before the dates on the
first page of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. The Commission’s Consumer and Governmental
Affairs Bureau, Reference Information Center, will send a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,
including the IRFA, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA).234
B.

Initial Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis

116.
This document contains proposed modified information collection requirements. The
Commission, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork burdens, invites the general public and
the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) to comment on the information collection requirements
contained in this document, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Public Law 104-13. In
addition, pursuant to the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002, Public Law 107-198, see 44
U.S.C. § 3506(c)(4), we seek specific comment on how we might further reduce the information
collection burden for small business concerns with fewer than 25 employees.
117.
This document does not contain proposed information collection(s) subject to the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), Public Law 104-13. In addition, therefore, it does not contain
any new or modified information collection burden for small business concerns with fewer than 25
employees, pursuant to the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002, Public Law 107-198, see 44
U.S.C. 3506(c)(4).

Ex Parte Rules – Permit-But-Disclose

118.
The proceeding this NPRM initiates shall be treated as a “permit-but-disclose”
proceeding in accordance with the Commission’s ex parte rules.235 Persons making ex parte presentations
must file a copy of any written presentation or a memorandum summarizing any oral presentation within
two business days after the presentation (unless a different deadline applicable to the Sunshine period
applies). Persons making oral ex parte presentations are reminded that memoranda summarizing the
presentation must (1) list all persons attending or otherwise participating in the meeting at which the ex
parte presentation was made, and (2) summarize all data presented and arguments made during the
presentation. If the presentation consisted in whole or in part of the presentation of data or arguments
already reflected in the presenter’s written comments, memoranda or other filings in the proceeding, the
presenter may provide citations to such data or arguments in his or her prior comments, memoranda, or
other filings (specifying the relevant page and/or paragraph numbers where such data or arguments can be
found) in lieu of summarizing them in the memorandum. Documents shown or given to Commission
staff during ex parte meetings are deemed to be written ex parte presentations and must be filed
consistent with rule 1.1206(b). In proceedings governed by rule 1.49(f) or for which the Commission has
made available a method of electronic filing, written ex parte presentations and memoranda summarizing
oral ex parte presentations, and all attachments thereto, must be filed through the electronic comment

APPENDIX B
Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
1.
As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended (RFA),1 the
Commission has prepared this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) of the possible significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities from the policies and rules proposed in this
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Notice). The Commission requests written public comment on this
IRFA. Comments must be identified as responses to the IRFA and must be filed by the deadlines for
comments on the Notice provided on the first page of the Notice. The Commission will send a copy of
the Notice, including this IRFA, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
(SBA).2 In addition, the Notice and IRFA (or summaries thereof) will be published in the Federal
Register.3
A.

Need for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Rules

2.
With this Notice, the Commission initiates a new rulemaking that proposes to restore the
market-based policies necessary to preserve the future of Internet Freedom, and to reverse the decline in
infrastructure investment, innovation, and options for American consumers put into motion by the
Commission in 2015. The Commission’s Title II Order has put at risk online investment and innovation,
threatening the very open Internet it purported to preserve. Investment in broadband networks declined.
Internet service providers (ISPs) have pulled back on plans to deploy new and upgraded infrastructure and
services to consumers. This is particularly true of the smallest Internet service providers that serve
consumers in rural, low-income, and other underserved communities. This rulemaking continues the
critical work to promote broadband deployment to rural consumers and infrastructure investment
throughout our nation, to brighten the future of innovation both within networks and at their edge, and to
close the digital divide.
3.
The Notice sets forth the following three main proposals: returning broadband Internet
access service to its previously-settled classification as an information service, restoring the definition of
“public switched telephone network” to its original meaning, and eliminating the Internet conduct
standard. The Notice also seeks comment on a variety of issues relating to the effects of the
Commission’s Title II Order, including the burdens imposed by the Title II Order that have led to
decreased investment and reduced innovation and have been felt by Internet service providers (ISPs) and
consumers. Additionally, the Notice seeks comment on the effects of reclassifying broadband Internet
access service as an information service on the existing enforcement regime and the necessity of the other
rules adopted in the Title II Order.
4.
First, the Notice proposes to return broadband Internet access service to its classification
as an information service. The Notice seeks comment on the text of the 1996 Act and whether the
language of the Act indicates that broadband Internet access is service is properly classified as an
information service. Addition, the Notice seeks comment on whether, and to what extent, Commission
precedent classifying broadband Internet access service as an information service should continue to
govern broadband Internet access service in the future. Second, the Notice proposes returning the
definition of “public switched telephone network” to its classification as it existed before the Title II
Order as an information service. Third, the Notice seeks comments on what effects, if any, returning
broadband Internet access service to its original classification as an information service would have on the

See 5 U.S.C. § 603. The RFA, see 5 U.S.C. §§ 601-12, has been amended by the Small Business Regulatory
Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA), Pub. L. No. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996).

regulatory structures created by the Title II Order.
5.
Next, the Notice proposes re-evaluating the existing rules and regulations imposed on
ISPs. The Notice proposes eliminating the Internet conduct standard, and it seeks comment on the
usefulness and necessity of the no-blocking rule, the no-throttling rule, the no paid prioritization rule, and
the transparency rule. The Notice also seeks comment on what an effective enforcement regime would
look like if broadband Internet access service is classified as an information service.
B.

Legal Basis

6.
The legal basis for any action that may be taken pursuant to the Notice is contained in
sections 3, 10, 201(b), 230, 254(e), 303(r), 332, of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and
section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§ 153, 160, 201(b), 254(e),
303(r), 332, 1302.
C.

Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Rules
Would Apply

7.
The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of, and where feasible, an estimate of
the number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed rules, if adopted.4 The RFA generally
defines the term “small entity” as having the same meaning as the terms “small business,” “small
organization,” and “small governmental jurisdiction.”5 In addition, the term “small business” has the
same meaning as the term “small-business concern” under the Small Business Act.6 A small-business
concern” is one which: (1) is independently owned and operated; (2) is not dominant in its field of
operation; and (3) satisfies any additional criteria established by the SBA.7
1.

Total Small Entities

8.
Our proposed action, if implemented, may, over time, affect small entities that are not
easily categorized at present. We therefore describe here, at the outset, three comprehensive, statutory
small entity size standards.8 First, nationwide, there are a total of approximately 28.2 million small
businesses, according to the SBA.9 In addition, a “small organization” is generally “any not-for-profit
enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.”10 Nationwide, as
of 2007, there were approximately 1,621,315 small organizations.11 Finally, the term “small
governmental jurisdiction” is defined generally as “governments of cities, towns, townships, villages,
school districts, or special districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.”12 Census Bureau data

See 5 U.S.C. § 603(b)(3).

See 5 U.S.C. § 601(6).

See 5 U.S.C. § 601(3) (incorporating by reference the definition of “small-business concern” in the Small Business
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 632). Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 601(3), the statutory definition of a small business applies “unless an
agency, after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity
for public comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the
agency and publishes such definition(s) in the Federal Register.”

for 2007 indicate that there were 89,476 local governmental jurisdictions in the United States.13 We
estimate that, of this total, as many as 88,761 entities may qualify as “small governmental jurisdictions.”14
Thus, we estimate that most governmental jurisdictions are small.
2.

Broadband Internet Access Service Providers

9.
The proposed rules would apply to broadband Internet access service providers (BIAS
providers). The Economic Census places these firms, whose services might include Voice over Internet
Protocol (VoIP), in either of two categories, depending on whether the service is provided over the
provider’s own telecommunications facilities (e.g., cable and DSL ISPs), or over client-supplied
telecommunications connections (e.g., dial-up ISPs). The former are within the category of Wired
Telecommunications Carriers,15 which has an SBA small business size standard of 1,500 or fewer
employees.16 These are also labeled “broadband.” The latter are within the category of All Other
Telecommunications,17 which has a size standard of annual receipts of $25 million or less.18 These are
labeled non-broadband. According to Census Bureau data for 2007, there were 3,188 firms in the first
category, total, that operated for the entire year.19 Of this total, 3144 firms had employment of 999 or
fewer employees, and 44 firms had employment of 1000 employees or more.20 For the second category,
the data show that 1,274 firms operated for the entire year.21 Of those, 1,252 had annual receipts below
$25 million per year. Consequently, we estimate that the majority of broadband Internet access service
provider firms are small entities.
10.
The broadband Internet access service provider industry has changed since this definition
was introduced in 2007. The data cited above may therefore include entities that no longer provide
broadband Internet access service, and may exclude entities that now provide such service. To ensure that
this IRFA describes the universe of small entities that our action might affect, we discuss in turn several

14

The 2007 U.S. Census data for small governmental organizations are not presented based on the size of the
population in each such organization. There were 89,476 local governmental organizations in 2007. If we assume
that county, municipal, township, and school district organizations are more likely than larger governmental
organizations to have populations of 50,000 or less, the total of these organizations is 52,095. As a basis of
estimating how many of these 89,476 local government organizations were small, in 2011, we note that there were a
total of 715 cities and towns (incorporated places and minor civil divisions) with populations over 50,000. City and
Town Totals Vintage: 2011 – U.S. Census Bureau, http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2011/index.html.
If we subtract the 715 cities and towns that meet or exceed the 50,000 population threshold, we conclude that
approximately 88,761 are small. U.S. Census Bureau, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2012, Section 8,

although we have no specific information on the number of small entities that provide broadband Internet
access service over unlicensed spectrum, we include these entities in our Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis.
3.

Wireline Providers

11.
Wired Telecommunications Carriers. The SBA has developed a small business size
standard for Wired Telecommunications Carriers, which consists of all such companies having 1,500 or
fewer employees.22 According to Census Bureau data for 2007, there were 3,188 firms in this category,
total, that operated for the entire year.23 Of this total, 3,144 firms had employment of 999 or fewer
employees, and 44 firms had employment of 1000 employees or more.24 Thus, under this size standard,
the majority of firms can be considered small.
12.
Local Exchange Carriers (LECs). Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a
size standard for small businesses specifically applicable to local exchange services. The closest
applicable size standard under SBA rules is for Wired Telecommunications Carriers. Under that size
standard, such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.25 According to Commission data,
1,307 carriers reported that they were incumbent local exchange service providers.26 Of these 1,307
carriers, an estimated 1,006 have 1,500 or fewer employees and 301 have more than 1,500 employees.27
Consequently, the Commission estimates that most providers of local exchange service are small entities
that may be affected by rules adopted pursuant to the Notice.
13.
Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (Incumbent LECs). Neither the Commission nor the
SBA has developed a small business size standard specifically for incumbent local exchange services.
The closest applicable size standard under SBA rules is for the category Wired Telecommunications
Carriers. Under that size standard, such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.28
According to Commission data,29 1,307 carriers reported that they were incumbent local exchange service
providers.30 Of these 1,307 carriers, an estimated 1,006 have 1,500 or fewer employees and 301 have
more than 1,500 employees.31 Consequently, the Commission estimates that most providers of incumbent
local exchange service are small businesses that may be affected by our proposed rules.

nor the SBA has developed a small business size standard specifically for these service providers. The
appropriate size standard under SBA rules is for the category Wired Telecommunications Carriers. Under
that size standard, such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.32 According to
Commission data, 1,442 carriers reported that they were engaged in the provision of either competitive
local exchange services or competitive access provider services.33 Of these 1,442 carriers, an estimated
1,256 have 1,500 or fewer employees and 186 have more than 1,500 employees.34 In addition, 17 carriers
have reported that they are Shared-Tenant Service Providers, and all 17 are estimated to have 1,500 or
fewer employees.35 In addition, 72 carriers have reported that they are Other Local Service Providers.36
Of the 72, seventy have 1,500 or fewer employees and two have more than 1,500 employees.37
Consequently, the Commission estimates that most providers of competitive local exchange service,
competitive access providers, Shared-Tenant Service Providers, and other local service providers are
small entities that may be affected by our proposed rules.
15.
We have included small incumbent LECs in this present RFA analysis. As noted above,
a “small business” under the RFA is one that, inter alia, meets the pertinent small business size standard
(e.g., a telephone communications business having 1,500 or fewer employees), and “is not dominant in its
field of operation.”38 The SBA’s Office of Advocacy contends that, for RFA purposes, small incumbent
LECs are not dominant in their field of operation because any such dominance is not “national” in
scope.39 We have therefore included small incumbent LECs in this RFA analysis, although we emphasize
that this RFA action has no effect on Commission analyses and determinations in other, non-RFA
contexts.
16.
Interexchange Carriers. Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a small
business size standard specifically for providers of interexchange services. The appropriate size standard
under SBA rules is for the category Wired Telecommunications Carriers. Under that size standard, such a
business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.40 According to Commission data,41 359 carriers have
reported that they are engaged in the provision of interexchange service. Of these, an estimated 317 have
1,500 or fewer employees and 42 have more than 1,500 employees. Consequently, the Commission
estimates that the majority of IXCs are small entities that may be affected by our proposed rules.
17.
Operator Service Providers (OSPs). Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed
a small business size standard specifically for operator service providers. The appropriate size standard
under SBA rules is for the category Wired Telecommunications Carriers. Under that size standard, such a

Letter from Jere W. Glover, Chief Counsel for Advocacy, SBA, to William E. Kennard, Chairman, Federal

business concern,” which the RFA incorporates into its own definition of “small business.” 15 U.S.C. § 632(a); 5
U.S.C. § 601(3). SBA regulations interpret “small business concern” to include the concept of dominance on a
national basis. 13 CFR § 121.102(b).

business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.42 According to Commission data, 33 carriers have
reported that they are engaged in the provision of operator services. Of these, an estimated 31 have 1,500
or fewer employees and two have more than 1,500 employees.43 Consequently, the Commission
estimates that the majority of OSPs are small entities that may be affected by our proposed rules.
18.
Other Toll Carriers. Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a size standard
for small businesses specifically applicable to Other Toll Carriers. This category includes toll carriers
that do not fall within the categories of interexchange carriers, operator service providers, prepaid calling
card providers, satellite service carriers, or toll resellers. The closest applicable size standard under SBA
rules is for Wired Telecommunications Carriers. Under that size standard, such a business is small if it
has 1,500 or fewer employees.44 According to Commission data, 284 companies reported that their
primary telecommunications service activity was the provision of other toll carriage.45 Of these, an
estimated 279 have 1,500 or fewer employees and five have more than 1,500 employees.46 Consequently,
the Commission estimates that most Other Toll Carriers are small entities that may be affected by rules
adopted pursuant to the Notice.
4.

Wireless Providers – Fixed and Mobile

19.
The broadband Internet access service provider category covered by these proposed rules
may cover multiple wireless firms and categories of regulated wireless services. Thus, to the extent the
wireless services listed below are used by wireless firms for broadband Internet access service, the
proposed actions may have an impact on those small businesses as set forth above and further below. In
addition, for those services subject to auctions, we note that, as a general matter, the number of winning
bidders that claim to qualify as small businesses at the close of an auction does not necessarily represent
the number of small businesses currently in service. Also, the Commission does not generally track
subsequent business size unless, in the context of assignments and transfers or reportable eligibility
events, unjust enrichment issues are implicated.
20.
Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite). Since 2007, the Census Bureau
has placed wireless firms within this new, broad, economic census category.47 Under the present and
prior categories, the SBA has deemed a wireless business to be small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees. 48
For the category of Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite), census data for 2007 show
that there were 1,383 firms that operated for the entire year.49 Of this total, 1,368 firms had employment
of 999 or fewer employees and 15 had employment of 1000 employees or more.50 Since all firms with
fewer than 1,500 employees are considered small, given the total employment in the sector, we estimate
that the vast majority of wireless firms are small.

Wireless Communications Services. This service can be used for fixed, mobile,
radiolocation, and digital audio broadcasting satellite uses. The Commission defined “small business” for
the wireless communications services (WCS) auction as an entity with average gross revenues of $40
million for each of the three preceding years, and a “very small business” as an entity with average gross
revenues of $15 million for each of the three preceding years.51 The SBA has approved these

services, and specialized mobile radio telephony carriers. As noted, the SBA has developed a small
business size standard for Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite).54 Under the SBA
small business size standard, a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.55 According to
Commission data, 413 carriers reported that they were engaged in wireless telephony.56 Of these, an
estimated 261 have 1,500 or fewer employees and 152 have more than 1,500 employees.57 Therefore, a
little less than one third of these entities can be considered small.
24.
Broadband Personal Communications Service. The broadband personal communications
services (PCS) spectrum is divided into six frequency blocks designated A through F, and the
Commission has held auctions for each block. The Commission initially defined a “small business” for
C- and F-Block licenses as an entity that has average gross revenues of $40 million or less in the three
previous calendar years.58 For F-Block licenses, an additional small business size standard for “very
small business” was added and is defined as an entity that, together with its affiliates, has average gross
revenues of not more than $15 million for the preceding three calendar years.59 These small business size
standards, in the context of broadband PCS auctions, have been approved by the SBA.60 No small
businesses within the SBA-approved small business size standards bid successfully for licenses in Blocks
A and B. There were 90 winning bidders that claimed small business status in the first two C-Block
auctions. A total of 93 bidders that claimed small business status won approximately 40 percent of the
1,479 licenses in the first auction for the D, E, and F Blocks.61 On April 15, 1999, the Commission

On January 26, 2001, the Commission completed the auction of 422 C and F Block
Broadband PCS licenses in Auction No. 35. Of the 35 winning bidders in that auction, 29 claimed small

Specialized Mobile Radio Licenses. The Commission awards “small entity” bidding
credits in auctions for Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) geographic area licenses in the 800 MHz and 900
MHz bands to firms that had revenues of no more than $15 million in each of the three previous calendar
years.69 The Commission awards “very small entity” bidding credits to firms that had revenues of no
more than $3 million in each of the three previous calendar years.70 The SBA has approved these small
business size standards for the 900 MHz Service.71 The Commission has held auctions for geographic
area licenses in the 800 MHz and 900 MHz bands. The 900 MHz SMR auction began on December 5,
1995, and closed on April 15, 1996. Sixty bidders claiming that they qualified as small businesses under
the $15 million size standard won 263 geographic area licenses in the 900 MHz SMR band. The 800
MHz SMR auction for the upper 200 channels began on October 28, 1997, and was completed on
December 8, 1997. Ten bidders claiming that they qualified as small businesses under the $15 million

second auction for the 800 MHz band was held on January 10, 2002 and closed on January 17, 2002 and
included 23 BEA licenses. One bidder claiming small business status won five licenses.73
27.
The auction of the 1,053 800 MHz SMR geographic area licenses for the General
Category channels began on August 16, 2000, and was completed on September 1, 2000. Eleven bidders
won 108 geographic area licenses for the General Category channels in the 800 MHz SMR band and
qualified as small businesses under the $15 million size standard.74 In an auction completed on December
5, 2000, a total of 2,800 Economic Area licenses in the lower 80 channels of the 800 MHz SMR service
were awarded.75 Of the 22 winning bidders, 19 claimed small business status and won 129 licenses.
Thus, combining all four auctions, 41 winning bidders for geographic licenses in the 800 MHz SMR band
claimed status as small businesses.
28.
In addition, there are numerous incumbent site-by-site SMR licenses and licensees with
extended implementation authorizations in the 800 and 900 MHz bands. We do not know how many
firms provide 800 MHz or 900 MHz geographic area SMR service pursuant to extended implementation
authorizations, nor how many of these providers have annual revenues of no more than $15 million. One
firm has over $15 million in revenues. In addition, we do not know how many of these firms have 1,500
or fewer employees, which is the SBA-determined size standard.76 We assume, for purposes of this
analysis, that all of the remaining extended implementation authorizations are held by small entities, as
defined by the SBA.
29.
Lower 700 MHz Band Licenses. The Commission previously adopted criteria for
defining three groups of small businesses for purposes of determining their eligibility for special
provisions such as bidding credits.77 The Commission defined a “small business” as an entity that,
together with its affiliates and controlling principals, has average gross revenues not exceeding $40
million for the preceding three years.78 A “very small business” is defined as an entity that, together with
its affiliates and controlling principals, has average gross revenues that are not more than $15 million for
the preceding three years.79 Additionally, the lower 700 MHz Service had a third category of small
business status for Metropolitan/Rural Service Area (MSA/RSA) licenses—“entrepreneur”—which is
defined as an entity that, together with its affiliates and controlling principals, has average gross revenues
that are not more than $3 million for the preceding three years.80 The SBA approved these small size
standards.81 An auction of 740 licenses (one license in each of the 734 MSAs/RSAs and one license in
each of the six Economic Area Groupings (EAGs)) commenced on August 27, 2002, and closed on
September 18, 2002. Of the 740 licenses available for auction, 484 licenses were won by 102 winning
bidders. Seventy-two of the winning bidders claimed small business, very small business or entrepreneur

13, 2003, and included 256 licenses: 5 EAG licenses and 476 Cellular Market Area licenses.83 Seventeen
winning bidders claimed small or very small business status and won 60 licenses, and nine winning
bidders claimed entrepreneur status and won 154 licenses.84 On July 26, 2005, the Commission
completed an auction of 5 licenses in the Lower 700 MHz band (Auction No. 60). There were three
winning bidders for five licenses. All three winning bidders claimed small business status.
30.
In 2007, the Commission reexamined its rules governing the 700 MHz band in the 700
MHz Second Report and Order.85 An auction of 700 MHz licenses commenced January 24, 2008 and
closed on March 18, 2008, which included, 176 Economic Area licenses in the A Block, 734 Cellular
Market Area licenses in the B Block, and 176 EA licenses in the E Block.86 Twenty winning bidders,
claiming small business status (those with attributable average annual gross revenues that exceed $15
million and do not exceed $40 million for the preceding three years) won 49 licenses. Thirty three
winning bidders claiming very small business status (those with attributable average annual gross
revenues that do not exceed $15 million for the preceding three years) won 325 licenses.
31.
Upper 700 MHz Band Licenses. In the 700 MHz Second Report and Order, the
Commission revised its rules regarding Upper 700 MHz licenses.87 On January 24, 2008, the
Commission commenced Auction 73 in which several licenses in the Upper 700 MHz band were
available for licensing: 12 Regional Economic Area Grouping licenses in the C Block, and one
nationwide license in the D Block.88 The auction concluded on March 18, 2008, with 3 winning bidders
claiming very small business status (those with attributable average annual gross revenues that do not
exceed $15 million for the preceding three years) and winning five licenses.
32.
700 MHz Guard Band Licensees. In 2000, in the 700 MHz Guard Band Order, the
Commission adopted size standards for “small businesses” and “very small businesses” for purposes of
determining their eligibility for special provisions such as bidding credits and installment payments.89 A
small business in this service is an entity that, together with its affiliates and controlling principals, has
average gross revenues not exceeding $40 million for the preceding three years.90 Additionally, a very

6, 2000, and closed on September 21, 2000.93 Of the 104 licenses auctioned, 96 licenses were sold to nine
bidders. Five of these bidders were small businesses that won a total of 26 licenses. A second auction of
700 MHz Guard Band licenses commenced on February 13, 2001, and closed on February 21, 2001. All

Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service. The Commission has previously used the SBA’s
small business size standard applicable to Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite), i.e.,
an entity employing no more than 1,500 persons.95 There are approximately 100 licensees in the AirGround Radiotelephone Service, and under that definition, we estimate that almost all of them qualify as
small entities under the SBA definition. For purposes of assigning Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service
licenses through competitive bidding, the Commission has defined “small business” as an entity that,
together with controlling interests and affiliates, has average annual gross revenues for the preceding
three years not exceeding $40 million.96 A “very small business” is defined as an entity that, together
with controlling interests and affiliates, has average annual gross revenues for the preceding three years
not exceeding $15 million.97 These definitions were approved by the SBA.98 In May 2006, the
Commission completed an auction of nationwide commercial Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service
licenses in the 800 MHz band (Auction No. 65). On June 2, 2006, the auction closed with two winning
bidders winning two Air-Ground Radiotelephone Services licenses. Neither of the winning bidders
claimed small business status.

annual gross revenues for the preceding three years not exceeding $40 million, and a “very small
business” as an entity with average annual gross revenues for the preceding three years not exceeding $15
million. For AWS-2 and AWS-3, although we do not know for certain which entities are likely to apply

for these frequencies, we note that the AWS-1 bands are comparable to those used for cellular service and
personal communications service. The Commission has not yet adopted size standards for the AWS-2 or
AWS-3 bands but proposes to treat both AWS-2 and AWS-3 similarly to broadband PCS service and
AWS-1 service due to the comparable capital requirements and other factors, such as issues involved in
relocating incumbents and developing markets, technologies, and services.100
35.
3650–3700 MHz band. In March 2005, the Commission released a Report and Order
and Memorandum Opinion and Order that provides for nationwide, non-exclusive licensing of terrestrial
operations, utilizing contention-based technologies, in the 3650 MHz band (i.e., 3650–3700 MHz). As of
April 2010, more than 1270 licenses have been granted and more than 7433 sites have been registered.
The Commission has not developed a definition of small entities applicable to 3650–3700 MHz band
nationwide, non-exclusive licensees. However, we estimate that the majority of these licensees are
Internet Access Service Providers (ISPs) and that most of those licensees are small businesses.
36.
Fixed Microwave Services. Microwave services include common carrier,101 privateoperational fixed,102 and broadcast auxiliary radio services.103 They also include the Local Multipoint
Distribution Service (LMDS),104 the Digital Electronic Message Service (DEMS),105 and the 24 GHz
Service,106 where licensees can choose between common carrier and non-common carrier status.107 At
present, there are approximately 36,708 common carrier fixed licensees and 59,291 private operationalfixed licensees and broadcast auxiliary radio licensees in the microwave services. There are
approximately 135 LMDS licensees, three DEMS licensees, and three 24 GHz licensees. The
Commission has not yet defined a small business with respect to microwave services. For purposes of the
IRFA, we will use the SBA’s definition applicable to Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except
satellite)—i.e., an entity with no more than 1,500 persons.108 Under the present and prior categories, the
SBA has deemed a wireless business to be small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.109 The Commission
does not have data specifying the number of these licensees that have more than 1,500 employees, and
thus is unable at this time to estimate with greater precision the number of fixed microwave service

licensees that would qualify as small business concerns under the SBA’s small business size standard.
Consequently, the Commission estimates that there are up to 36,708 common carrier fixed licensees and
up to 59,291 private operational-fixed licensees and broadcast auxiliary radio licensees in the microwave
services that may be small and may be affected by the rules and policies adopted herein. We note,
however, that the common carrier microwave fixed licensee category includes some large entities.
37.
Broadband Radio Service and Educational Broadband Service. Broadband Radio
Service systems, previously referred to as Multipoint Distribution Service (MDS) and Multichannel
Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS) systems, and “wireless cable,” transmit video programming to
subscribers and provide two-way high speed data operations using the microwave frequencies of the
Broadband Radio Service (BRS) and Educational Broadband Service (EBS) (previously referred to as the
Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS)).110 In connection with the 1996 BRS auction, the
Commission established a small business size standard as an entity that had annual average gross
revenues of no more than $40 million in the previous three calendar years.111 The BRS auctions resulted
in 67 successful bidders obtaining licensing opportunities for 493 Basic Trading Areas (BTAs). Of the 67
auction winners, 61 met the definition of a small business. BRS also includes licensees of stations
authorized prior to the auction. At this time, we estimate that of the 61 small business BRS auction
winners, 48 remain small business licensees. In addition to the 48 small businesses that hold BTA
authorizations, there are approximately 392 incumbent BRS licensees that are considered small entities.112
After adding the number of small business auction licensees to the number of incumbent licensees not
already counted, we find that there are currently approximately 440 BRS licensees that are defined as
small businesses under either the SBA or the Commission’s rules.
38.
In 2009, the Commission conducted Auction 86, the sale of 78 licenses in the BRS
areas. The Commission offered three levels of bidding credits: (i) a bidder with attributed average
annual gross revenues that exceed $15 million and do not exceed $40 million for the preceding three
years (small business) received a 15 percent discount on its winning bid; (ii) a bidder with attributed
average annual gross revenues that exceed $3 million and do not exceed $15 million for the preceding
three years (very small business) received a 25 percent discount on its winning bid; and (iii) a bidder with
attributed average annual gross revenues that do not exceed $3 million for the preceding three years
(entrepreneur) received a 35 percent discount on its winning bid.114 Auction 86 concluded in 2009 with
the sale of 61 licenses.115 Of the ten winning bidders, two bidders that claimed small business status won
4 licenses; one bidder that claimed very small business status won three licenses; and two bidders that
claimed entrepreneur status won six licenses.

standard is applicable to EBS. There are presently 2,436 EBS licensees. All but 100 of these licenses are
held by educational institutions. Educational institutions are included in this analysis as small entities.116
Thus, we estimate that at least 2,336 licensees are small businesses. Since 2007, Cable Television
Distribution Services have been defined within the broad economic census category of Wired
Telecommunications Carriers; that category is defined as follows: “This industry comprises
establishments primarily engaged in operating and/or providing access to transmission facilities and
infrastructure that they own and/or lease for the transmission of voice, data, text, sound, and video using
wired telecommunications networks. Transmission facilities may be based on a single technology or a
combination of technologies.”117 The SBA has developed a small business size standard for this category,
which is: all such firms having 1,500 or fewer employees. To gauge small business prevalence for these
cable services we must, however, use the most current census data that are based on the previous category
of Cable and Other Program Distribution and its associated size standard; that size standard was: all such
firms having $13.5 million or less in annual receipts.118 According to Census Bureau data for 2007, there
were a total of 996 firms in this category that operated for the entire year.119 Of this total, 948 firms had
annual receipts of under $10 million, and 48 firms had receipts of $10 million or more but less than $25
million.120 Thus, the majority of these firms can be considered small.
5.

Satellite Service Providers

40.
Satellite Telecommunications Providers. Two economic census categories address the
satellite industry. The first category has a small business size standard of $30 million or less in average
annual receipts, under SBA rules.121 The second has a size standard of $30 million or less in annual
receipts.122
41.
The category of Satellite Telecommunications “comprises establishments primarily
engaged in providing telecommunications services to other establishments in the telecommunications and
broadcasting industries by forwarding and receiving communications signals via a system of satellites or
reselling satellite telecommunications.”123 For this category, Census Bureau data for 2007 show that there
were a total of 570 firms that operated for the entire year.124 Of this total, 530 firms had annual receipts of
under $30 million, and 40 firms had receipts of over $30 million.125 Consequently, we estimate that the
majority of Satellite Telecommunications firms are small entities that might be affected by our action.
42.

The second category of Other Telecommunications comprises, inter alia, “establishments

The term “small entity” within SBREFA applies to small organizations (nonprofits) and to small governmental
jurisdictions (cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, and special districts with populations of
less than 50,000). 5 U.S.C. §§ 601(4)-(6). We do not collect annual revenue data on EBS licensees.

primarily engaged in providing specialized telecommunications services, such as satellite tracking,
communications telemetry, and radar station operation. This industry also includes establishments
primarily engaged in providing satellite terminal stations and associated facilities connected with one or
more terrestrial systems and capable of transmitting telecommunications to, and receiving
telecommunications from, satellite systems.”126 For this category, Census Bureau data for 2007 show that
there were a total of 1,274 firms that operated for the entire year.127 Of this total, 1,252 had annual
receipts below $25 million per year.128 Consequently, we estimate that the majority of All Other
Telecommunications firms are small entities that might be affected by our action.
6.

Cable Service Providers

43.
Because section 706 requires us to monitor the deployment of broadband using any
technology, we anticipate that some broadband service providers may not provide telephone service.
Accordingly, we describe below other types of firms that may provide broadband services, including
cable companies, MDS providers, and utilities, among others.
44.
Cable and Other Program Distributors. Since 2007, these services have been defined
within the broad economic census category of Wired Telecommunications Carriers; that category is
defined as follows: “This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in operating and/or
providing access to transmission facilities and infrastructure that they own and/or lease for the
transmission of voice, data, text, sound, and video using wired telecommunications networks.
Transmission facilities may be based on a single technology or a combination of technologies.”129 The
SBA has developed a small business size standard for this category, which is: all such firms having 1,500
or fewer employees. To gauge small business prevalence for these cable services we must, however, use
current census data that are based on the previous category of Cable and Other Program Distribution and
its associated size standard; that size standard was: all such firms having $13.5 million or less in annual
receipts.130 According to Census Bureau data for 2007, there were a total of 2,048 firms in this category
that operated for the entire year.131 Of this total, 1,393 firms had annual receipts of under $10 million, and
655 firms had receipts of $10 million or more.132 Thus, the majority of these firms can be considered
small.
45.
Cable Companies and Systems. The Commission has also developed its own small
business size standards, for the purpose of cable rate regulation. Under the Commission’s rules, a “small
cable company” is one serving 400,000 or fewer subscribers, nationwide.133 Industry data shows that

there were 1,141 cable companies at the end of June 2012.134 Of this total, all but ten cable operators
nationwide are small under this size standard.135 In addition, under the Commission’s rules, a “small
system” is a cable system serving 15,000 or fewer subscribers.136 Current Commission records show
4,945 cable systems nationwide.137 Of this total, 4,380 cable systems have less than 20,000 subscribers,
and 565 systems have 20,000 or more subscribers, based on the same records. Thus, under this standard,
we estimate that most cable systems are small entities.
46.
Cable System Operators. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, also contains a
size standard for small cable system operators, which is “a cable operator that, directly or through an
affiliate, serves in the aggregate fewer than 1 percent of all subscribers in the United States and is not
affiliated with any entity or entities whose gross annual revenues in the aggregate exceed
$250,000,000.”138 The Commission has determined that an operator serving fewer than 677,000
subscribers shall be deemed a small operator, if its annual revenues, when combined with the total annual
revenues of all its affiliates, do not exceed $250 million in the aggregate.139 Based on available data, we
find that all but ten incumbent cable operators are small entities under this size standard.140 We note that
the Commission neither requests nor collects information on whether cable system operators are affiliated
with entities whose gross annual revenues exceed $250 million,141 and therefore we are unable to estimate
more accurately the number of cable system operators that would qualify as small under this size
standard.

Electric Power Generators, Transmitters, and Distributors. The Census Bureau defines
this industry as including “establishments primarily engaged in providing specialized telecommunications
services, such as satellite tracking, communications telemetry, and radar station operation. This industry

operators use one or more cable systems to provide video service. See Annual Assessment of the Status of

We note that, when applied to an MVPD operator, under this size standard (i.e., 400,000 or fewer subscribers) all
but 14 MVPD operators would be considered small. See NCTA, Industry Data, Top 25 Multichannel Video Service
Customers (2012), http://www.ncta.com/industry-data. The Commission applied this size standard to MVPD
operators in its implementation of the CALM Act. See Implementation of the Commercial Advertisement Loudness
Mitigation (CALM) Act, MB Docket No. 11-93, Report and Order, 26 FCC Rcd 17222, 17245-46, para. 37 (2011)

also includes establishments primarily engaged in providing satellite terminal stations and associated
facilities connected with one or more terrestrial systems and capable of transmitting telecommunications
to, and receiving telecommunications from, satellite systems. Establishments providing Internet services
or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services via client-supplied telecommunications connections are
also included in this industry.”142 The SBA has developed a small business size standard for this
category; that size standard is $32.5 million or less in average annual receipts.143 According to Census
Bureau data for 2007, there were 2,383 firms in this category that operated for the entire year.144 Of these,
2,346 firms had annual receipts of under $25 million and 37 firms had annual receipts of $25 million or
more.145 Consequently, we estimate that the majority of these firms are small entities that may be affected
by rules adopted pursuant to the Notice.
D.

Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance
Requirements for Small Entities

48.
As indicated above, the Notice seeks comment on modifications to the Commission’s
existing no-blocking rule, no-throttling rule, no paid prioritization rule, and transparency rule, and it
proposes eliminating the Internet conduct standard. While we anticipate that the removal or modification
of burdensome regulations will lead to a long-term reduction in reporting, recordkeeping, or other
compliance requirements on some small entities, the potential modifications, if adopted, could initially
impose additional reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements on some small entities.146
E.

Steps Taken to Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities,
and Significant Alternatives Considered

49.
The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant alternatives that it has considered
in reaching its proposed approach, which may include (among others) the following four alternatives:
(1) the establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into
account the resources available to small entities; (2) the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of
compliance or reporting requirements under the rule for small entities; (3) the use of performance, rather
than design, standards; and (4) an exemption from coverage of the rule, or any part thereof, for small
entities.147 We expect to consider all of these factors when we have received substantive comment from
the public and potentially affected entities.
50.
The Commission expects to consider the economic impact on small entities, as identified
in comments filed in response to the Notice and this IRFA, in reaching its final conclusions and taking
action in this proceeding.
51.
We seek comment here on the effect the various proposals described in the Notice, and
summarized above, will have on small entities, and on what effect alternative rules would have on those
entities. How can the Commission achieve its goal of protecting and promoting an open Internet while
also imposing minimal burdens on small entities? What specific steps could the Commission take in this
regard?
